Ingredients CHICKEN SEASONING: 1 lb boneless skinless chicken breasts, cut into bite sized pieces 1 teaspoon kosher salt, (see note) 1 teaspoon onion powder 1 teaspoon garlic powder 1/2 teaspoon fresh ground pepper SAUCE: 1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened 1 teaspoon olive oil 2 teaspoons minced garlic 1 teaspoon Italian seasonings 2 tablespoons lemon juice 1 tablespoon sriracha 1/2 cup low-sodium chicken broth 1 lb asparagus, trimmed 1 tablespoon Italian parsley, minced Equipment large skillet (I love this nontoxic one from GreenPan)  Place chicken in a medium bowl and toss with the spices (salt, onion powder, garlic powder, and pepper). In a large skillet, melt over medium low heat half of the butter (1/4 cup) and 1 teaspoon of olive oil. Cook the chicken in the butter until all sides are golden brown being careful not to burn the butter. Add 1 teaspoon of minced garlic and Italian seasoning and cook for about 30 seconds. Remove the chicken from the pan and set aside. In the same skillet increase heat to medium high, add the remaining 1 teaspoon minced garlic then add the chicken broth to deglaze the pan. Add the remaining 1/4 cup butter, lemon juice, and sriracha. Add the asparagus and cook to desired tenderness. Add the chicken back to the pan and stir for another minute to reheat. Garnish the chicken and asparagus with parsley and lemon slices. Serve.  If you're substituting fine salt or table salt for the kosher salt in the recipe, use only 3/4 teaspoon or it will be too salty. Table salt is saltier than kosher salt or coarse sea salt. Table salt has smaller individual crystals, so more crystals of table salt than kosher or sea salt will fit into a measuring spoon. Slightly adapted from EatWell.

        "text": "High-Protein Marry Me Chicken Pasta (58g of protein) Danielle Lima Posted onNovember 3, 2024 Updated onAugust 23, 2024 This Marry Me Chicken Pasta has deliciously seasoned chicken, a homemade creamy cottage cheese sauce (no heavy cream!), sun-dried tomatoes and perfectly coated noodles. Whether you're making this for a special occasion or busy weeknight family dinner, this easy high-protein and gluten-free dish has you covered in under 30 minutes. Marriage proposal not included.  A large skillet full of creamy pasta with sun dried tomatoes and basil strips on top and spoon for serving. A creamy sun-dried tomato chicken pasta is everything good in this world. Yummy juicy chicken, a homemade cream sauce (without any cream) that’s to die for and pasta shells to hold in all the flavor in every bite. Is it worthy of a marriage proposal? Who knows. With high-protein dishes this good, who cares? To make this a nice high-protein dish we’re ditching the heavy cream and using cottage cheese instead. The cottage cheese makes the sauce rich and creamy without overloading it with calories and fat. This silky smooth sauce has tons of flavor from sun-dried tomatoes and pairs perfectly with seasoned chicken and pasta shells. Are you new to adding cottage cheese to everything? Try it in cottage cheese lasagna, my favorite chilled cottage cheese queso and definitely in a tropical cottage cheese smoothie. Why you’ll love this recipe 58 grams of protein per serving. Made with only simple ingredients. High-protein and gluten-free. Ingredients and Substitutes: These are the main ingredients and substitutions. See the recipe card below for the full ingredients list and instructions for this creamy chicken pasta. Chicken breast, parmesan cheese, sundried tomatoes, chicken broth, chickpea shells, garlic powder, oil from sundried tomatoes, italian seasoning. salt and pepper, cottage cheese and spinach for pasta. Chickpea Noodles: I used chickpea shells to make this gluten-free. I prefer a shell or short pasta, like rotini or penne pasta. Boneless Skinless Chicken Breasts: this could be swapped for ground chicken or for a richer flavor, use boneless skinless chicken thighs. Sun-Dried Tomatoes and the Oil: there’s no olive oil in this recipe. Instead, we are using the flavorful oil from the jar of sun-dried tomatoes that usually gets discarded. Low-Fat Cottage Cheese: puts the creamy to our creamy sauce. Cottage cheese gives the sauce a beautiful texture and adds protein and richness. You can use full-fat to make this an even more creamy pasta dish, but it really doesn’t need it. Chicken Broth: I always use low sodium so I can decide the amount of salt. You can use chicken stock or bone broth instead. For a richer meal, make this with tortellini or gnocchi. Spice up the night by adding red pepper flakes. Dietary Modifications This delicious pasta is gluten-free. To make this dairy-free you can use 1/2 cup to 3/4 cup full fat canned coconut milk and arrowroot or cornstarch to thicken it as needed. It won’t be the same but it’ll still get some creaminess. Let’s make marry me chicken pasta (a step-by-step guide): Step 1: cook the pasta and chicken Cook the pasta according to the package instructions. If using chickpea pasta, I like to undercook it by a minute so it doesn’t get mushy. Add the chicken, Italian seasoning, salt and pepper to a large mixing bowl (image 1). Mix to evenly coat the chicken (image 2). In a large skillet over medium heat, add the oil from the sundried tomatoes. Once hot, add the seasoned chicken and cook on each side (image 3), untouched, for 3-4 minutes or until cooked through and no longer pink (image 4). Seasoned chicken in a bowl and added to a large pan to brown. Step 2: blend your creamy sun-dried tomato sauce While the chicken cooks, add the cottage cheese, chicken broth, garlic powder and oil from the sundried tomatoes in a high speed blender (image 5) and blend until smooth and the cottage cheese is no longer chunky or chalky, approximately 4-5 minutes (image 6). Two images showing blending the cottage cheese, garlic powder, and oil from the sundried tomatoes in a blender cup. Step 3: add pasta and sauce to cooked chicken Turn heat to low. Add the cooked and drained pasta to the pan with the cooked chicken along with the blended cottage cheese sauce (image 7). Add the parmesan cheese, sun-dried tomatoes, Italian seasoning, salt, and black pepper (image 8). Stir to melt the cheese and heat the sauce. This will only take a couple of minutes. Add the spinach (image 9) and stir to wilt (image 10). Process images showing adding the cottage cheese sauce to the chicken and noodles then the parmesan cheese, sundried tomatoes, salt, pepper and Italian seasoning, mixing to combine and then wilting in the spinach to great the creamy pasta. Expert Tips! Turn heat to low when adding sauce ingredients to the pan. This prevents the sauce from watering down and will keep it nice and creamy. Al dente pasta is slightly undercooked pasta. It’s recommended for this recipe because the pasta will continue to cook once added to your cream sauce. Recipe FAQs What kind of noodle is best? How to store leftover chicken pasta?

The ingredients in this recipe are a great start! With alternatives to satisfy your preferences or just help you clean out your fridge, this high protein vegan stir fry will be one of the top meals you rely on when life gets busy. Easy Stir Fry Dishes Stir fry dishes are some of the most versatile out there, so I really can’t believe they weren’t a staple in my house growing up. They’re also extremely easy to make without animal products, while still satisfying everyone’s taste and texture preferences. My spicy peanut tofu stir fry is still a family favorite, and I have two sheet pan stir fry recipes, too. My sheet pan tofu stir fry and sheet pan miso tempeh stir fry are delicious and easy for weeknights, too. All of these include easy to prepare starches and sauces made from pantry ingredients versus fresh ones that take a while to prep. But, this new one graces our plates when we’re out of our staple plant protein sources. Shelf Stable Vegan Stir Fry I suppose the sheet pan stir fry dishes I mention above are technically shelf stable, too, since tempeh and tofu can last for months in your refrigerator after purchase. But, since this one can be made with only pantry and freezer ingredients, it takes it a step further! When it’s been awhile since your last grocery trip (or you’re stuck at home COVID-19 social distance style) these are the ingredients you want to rely on. When I haven’t been grocery shopping to have fresh items on hand, it usually means life is too busy for even a 30 minute dinner. This high protein vegan stir fry comes together in just 15 minutes! High Protein Vegan Stir Fry Ingredients I’ve already alluded to the frozen veggies being a key component here. As you can see, I love any, including green beans. But, broccoli and even bags of mixed vegetables will do, too. When it comes to the protein content though, rice is surprisingly the star! I have nothing against regular rice – we always have it on hand. However, it takes a really long time to cook and is low in both protein and fiber. This means it won’t be very filling and satisfying without another significant protein source and that athletes and active individuals are missing an opportunity to continue optimal muscle repair and recovery processes. So, I introduce you to legume rice. I’ve been a fan of bean pastas for years now, but legume rice is brand new as of 2019. The first brand I tried was Banza. It’s a blend of chickpeas and lentils and totally does the job for this stir fry. However, it’s texture is a bit more like orzo than real rice, and it does involve more time to boil water and drain it. Our number one favorite, Right Rice, was unfortunately discontinued, but we’re excited to see a new brand, Kaizen, on the market, which has 20 grams of protein per serving, blowing both of the aforementioned brands out of the water! It’s made from lupini bean and fava bean protein. You can get both at Whole Foods, Target or grab them on Amazon, too. vegan high protein stir fry Recipe  If you’re using actual rice, be sure to add another protein source such as tofu, additional edamame, or eggs. Rice is delicious, but is very low in protein and fiber. Athletes or individuals engaging in heavy lifting may want to add an additional cup of edamame to the recipe. Feel free to swap in any vegetables that you have on had, whether frozen or fresh. Frozen broccoli, cauliflower, green beans and peas all work well. In lieu of coconut aminos you can use soy sauce, and if you don’t have gochujang, you can alternatively use red chili paste or kimchi paste. High Protein Vegan Stir Fry This easy high protein vegan stir fry comes together with pantry and freezer ingredients in 15 minutes! Perfect for when you haven't shopped in a while. Prep Time 3 mins Cook Time 12 mins Total Time 15 mins Course Main Course Cuisine American, asian  Cook rice according to package directions.

        "text": "Chicken & Spinach Skillet Pasta with Lemon & Parmesan an image of the Chicken & Spinach Skillet Pasta with Lemon & Parmesan Photo: Photographer: Jake Sternquist, Food Stylist: Holly Dreesman, Prop Stylist: Natalie Ghazali The Simple Skillet Dinner Winner That My Mom Taught Me and I Can’t Live Without I grew up with the good fortune of having an amazing cook for a mom. She was entirely self-taught and—while everyone who ate at our house raved about her delicious meals—her endgame wasn’t about being an amazing cook. It was about making a dinner that tasted good, didn’t take too long and was achievable for anyone! Basically, she was just a normal working mom who wanted to feed her family healthy meals, and she just happened to be really, really good at it. I learned so much from hanging in the kitchen with my mom. But the lessons that stuck with me were all about timing, shortcuts and producing as few dishes to clean up as possible. She was a master of throwing together an easy weeknight dinner that tasted good enough to be a weekend dinner-party meal. One example was a simple garlicky pasta dish that was an all-in-one meal. It had protein from chicken (or shrimp if we were feeling fancy!), whole grains from the pasta, and a serving of veggies from lots of wilty spinach—all topped with Parmesan cheese for good measure. The night we first made it, it became an instant favorite. My mom wrote it down on a recipe card with the title “Devon’s Favorite Pasta” to add to a recipe book she was making for me to take to college. It remains in my regular dinner rotation to this day. Here are the best tips this recipe taught me, which are the keys to making a delicious and easy weeknight dinner. 1. Use as Few Pans as Possible When my dad wasn’t traveling for work, he was in charge of doing the dishes (another lesson from my mom I continue to use in my life—if I cook, you clean) so this rule doesn’t necessarily apply if you aren’t the one doing the dishes. But when you are, this rule is key. Don’t use any more pans than you have to. In this recipe, that means you cook the protein, veggies and sauce all in one skillet. Then, just add the cooked pasta to the same skillet, toss it all together and dinner is ready. 2. Use Quick-Cooking Ingredients You can’t make dinner fast if your ingredients don’t cook fast. So choose things that are quick-cooking, or take shortcuts to make them quick-cooking. In this recipe, that includes: Chicken breasts: We make them cook fast by cutting them into bite-size pieces first. Or try shrimp for another fast-cooking protein that’s delicious in this recipe. Spinach: When adding vegetables, choose naturally tender vegetables, which take less time to cook than stalky, hearty vegetables. In this recipe, the residual heat from cooking the chicken and pasta is enough to wilt down the spinach—no true cooking required. Other leafy greens, like kale, would work too. Pasta: Using whole-wheat or gluten-free pasta is one of the quickest ways to get your whole grains in. Plus, you can easily cook the pasta while you make the rest of the meal, so everything is ready to go at the same time. 3. Choose Just a Few Flavor-Packed Ingredients Cooking with fewer ingredients not only simplifies the actual cooking process, it also means you probably already have all the ingredients on hand (one less stop at the store!), and it’s quicker to put everything away at the end. To keep the ingredients list small, make every ingredient count by choosing ones that pack in lots of flavor. In this recipe, that includes: Garlic: Alliums like garlic, shallot and onion are key to flavoring savory dishes. White wine: A little bit of wine goes a long way when making pasta sauce. Other flavorful liquids, like broth, work too. Lemon: Adding an acidic ingredient like citrus or vinegar helps brighten the flavors of a dish and make it pop! Parmesan cheese: It may seem like just a garnish, but that sharp, salty flavor goes a long way. A fresh herb garnish is just as good, especially if you are watching your sodium intake.   Both chicken breast and chicken thighs fit into a healthy diet and are delicious in this dish. If you want to reduce the amount of fat, use chicken breast or remove the skin and trim the fat from the thighs. Both breast and thigh provide protein, B vitamins and choline—all necessary for a healthy nervous system. Because whole-wheat pasta is made with whole-grain wheat flour, it offers more nutrition in the form of vitamins, minerals, fiber and antioxidants than pasta made with refined white flour. While the difference in taste between whole-wheat pasta and regular pasta made with white flour is subtle, you can help ease the transition to whole-wheat pasta by making half the pasta in this dish whole-wheat and half regular pasta. And if you just prefer regular pasta, that’s OK! You’ll still get the same nutrients as whole-wheat pasta, just in smaller quantities for many of them. Besides adding gorgeous color to this dish, spinach also brings with it some fiber and vitamins A and K. Vitamin A supports healthy vision and immunity, and vitamin K is necessary for strong bones and healthy blood clotting. The antioxidants in spinach also contribute to reduced inflammation and disease risk. an image of the ingredients to make the Chicken & Spinach Skillet Pasta with Lemon & Parmesan Photographer: Jake Sternquist, Food Stylist: Holly Dreesman, Prop Stylist: Natalie Ghazali",

Each serving has 22 grams of protein, 0 grams of carbs, and just 185 calories. It’s super easy to make and goes perfectly with rice or cauliflower rice. Or you can get creative and use it to make things like lettuce wraps or a veggie stir fry with noodles. two bowls of firecracker ground chicken with rice How to Make Firecracker Chicken with Ground Chicken I doubt you’ll need much help with this recipe, but I’ve included a recipe walkthrough and ingredient notes in the post below nonetheless. Feel free to hit the jump to recipe button at the top of the post and hop back here if you have recipe or ingredient questions. Brown one pound of ground chicken in 1/2 tablespoon of chili oil or your choice of oil. browning ground chicken in a skillet The recipe calls for 92% lean ground chicken, but you could use leaner. You could also swap the ground chicken for ground turkey or your choice of ground meat. Like I mention in my ground chicken breakfast sausage recipe, using a little bit of oil is not entirely necessary, but it adds a ton of flavor and helps the chicken brown nicely. That browning adds a ton of flavor you might miss out on otherwise. I would definitely use a leaner cut of ground chicken before omitting the oil if you wanted to save a few calories! Make the firecracker sauce while the ground chicken cooks. ingredients for firecracker sauce in a mixing bowl Everything you’ll need for the firecracker sauce: buffalo sauce cider or rice vinegar zero-calorie Swerve brown sugar (or dark brown sugar) garlic powder ground ginger red pepper flakes salt and pepper Simply mix everything together and you’ll be ready to crack on. firecracker sauce whisked together If you’re unfamiliar with Swerve sweeteners, they’re zero-calorie, erythritol-based sugar substitutes that taste and cook like real sugar. I’ve used their brown sugar substitute to make everything from Nashville Hot ground chicken burgers to air fryer apple fritters. You’ll find notes for nutrition facts with real brown sugar in the recipe card at the bottom of the post. I’ll also mention that my chili crisp ground chicken and spicy coconut ground chicken recipes both use honey and gochujang as a sticky sweetener substitute. That might be an option. Update: If you like this sauce, you can use it to make my firecracker chicken meatballs recipe! Mince the ground chicken and finish cooking before adding the sauce. Cook until the sauce thickens, about 2-3 minutes. firecracker sauce added to cooked ground chicken You’re looking for a thick, syrupy, slightly sticky sauce. As long as you keep everything moving around, you shouldn’t be at risk of burning anything. Give it time! Serving Your Firecracker Ground Chicken The classic rice and protein bowls are my go-to with this recipe. If you wanted to keep things lower carb, using cauliflower rice is the obvious choice. One “hack” you could pull from my ground beef and rice skillet is mixing half cauliflower rice and half regular rice to mask the veggie-ness. You could also swap the rice for quinoa like in my spicy sesame ground beef and quinoa bowls. And if you wanted to add some veggies, you could pan roast some broccoli or something similar before cooking the chicken like in my sweet and spicy ground chicken and broccoli recipe. To make things a bit more interesting, you could plug this firecracker ground chicken into something like these chicken lettuce wraps or my low carb noodle stir fry. That should cover it.

Chicken added to sheet pan with quartered red potatoes. Green beans in bowl with seasoning and parmesan. Chicken, green beans and potatoes on sheet pan.  and Reheating: Store leftovers in an airtight container for up to 3-4 days. I prefer storing each ingredient in a separate container but you can portion out individual meals in a single dish as well! To freeze, make sure everything is cooled completely. Then transfer to a freezer safe airtight container. Freeze for up to 3 months. Again, you can freeze as individual meals or just as ingredients. To Reheat, I find that air frying is the very best option so if you have one, definitely use it! Heat for about 4-5 minutes at 350°F for the crispiest potatoes and parmesan crust on the chicken. You can also bake at 350°F for about 8-10 minutes or just microwave for about 1 1/2 to 2 minutes, more as needed.

Crispy roasted potatoes, garlic green beans and juicy, parmesan crusted chicken is a meal everyone will be begging for! Parmesan crusted chicken sheet pan dinner cooked on baking sheet. Prep Time: 15 minutes Cook Time: 40 minutes Total Time: 1 hour Cook ModePrevent your screen from going dark  Preheat oven to 425°F. Line a sheet pan with parchment for easier cleaning or spray with cooking oil. In a medium bowl, toss all ingredients for potatoes together and stir well to evenly coat. Spread the potatoes on 1/3 of the pan and place in oven for about 10-15 minutes. (if you like your potatoes nice and browned, go with the extra five minutes.) While potatoes are cooking, toss all ingredients for chicken in the same bowl and coat all the chicken well. Remove the pan with the potatoes and add the chicken. Place in oven while you toss everything together for the green beans and add them to the pan. Bake for about 25 minutes or until chicken reaches an internal temperature of 165°F. For extra crispy potatoes, turn the oven to broil on high for 4-5 more minutes if desired. Remove from oven and allow to cool several minutes before serving. Enjoy!  The biggest thing that will vary this recipe for most of us will be the thickness and size of your chicken breasts. While the going time for a chicken breast at 425°F is about 25 minutes, not all pieces of chicken are created equal. If your chicken seems super large or thick, plan for some extra time. Salt and pepper is really however you prefer. I always season my chicken with a decent amount of pepper and a pinch of salt or so. You don’t have to go all in from the get fo, feel free to add in more at the end! The bottom of the chicken is not as crispy as the top will get. You can use a rack on your sheet pan to allow any moisture to fall below versus staying on the chicken. You can add other herbs or seasoning to the dish. I like to toss in some Italian seasoning or even just some oregano to the chicken and potatoes sometimes. About 1/2 – 1 teaspoon is great.

I know you’re here and I know you’re ready for this romantically heavy fork-twist of creamy mushroom fettuccine. This creamy mushroom fettuccine is winter food at its most delushious. Like, if there was ever a reason to be a little less sad that it’s still winter and you’re going to stay in yet again for a date night, this would be it. Silky smooth noodles coated in just the right amount of luxurious sauce, speckled with garlic-buttery pan-roasted mushrooms. Oh yes we did. Bring it in. Group hug. Here’s how this is going down. First: We garlic-butter the pan – and how much do you love the term garlic-butter as a verb? A little garlic, a little butter, preferably Land O Lakes® salted, sweet cream butter. Because, some butter just tastes better, you know? Prefer To Watch Instead Of Read? Land O'Lakes Salted Butter. Second: We throw in the mushrooms, and our garlic butter mushrooms become a creamy sauce. Add a little cream, add the rest of the butter (again, high quality, good-tasting cream and butter go a long way here which is why we are using Land O Lakes® for both). Now just stand there and watch, mesmerized, as it melts together. Very important step. Season with salt and pepper, and that’s literally all there is to it. Mushrooms, butter, and heavy cream in pan on stove. Finally: We toss our creamy sauce in with the hot fettuccine. A handful of finely grated Parmesan here and a little bit of reserved pasta water there are going to help the consistency get just right. As in: creamy, but not gloppy; luscious, but not overwhelming. At this point I recommend just grabbing your tongs and tossing it all around again and again and again and watching with pure delight as it all comes together. It’s hot, steamy, and SO GOOD. Honestly, this is mega date night material. Mushroom Fettuccine in pan bring served with tongs. Finishing touches: Parsley (always! need that green) and a dusting of fresh cracked black pepper. If you want to be especially fancy – it is date night, after all – you can add a drizzle of truffle oil (!!) to the pasta. Just a tablespoon or two will do the trick. And suddenly you’re working with restaurant-level deliciousness in a matter of 30 minutes or less. Recommended eating scenarios include as a side for some nice pan-seared chicken or steak, as its own thing with a green salad to fill out the plate, or literally straight out of the pan as you stand in the kitchen in your sweats.

Grate the parmesan cheese. I prep other ingredients while I'm going along. Boil a large, salted pot of water for the fettuccine. Cook it al dente according to package directions. Meanwhile, cut the chicken breasts in half lengthwise so you have 4 thinner cutlets. Sprinkle them with the garlic powder and salt & pepper on both sides. Coat them in flour. In a deep skillet over medium-high heat, add the olive oil and 1 tablespoon of the butter. When the pan is hot, cook the chicken for 5 minutes/side or until golden and cooked through. Take the pan off the heat, and remove the chicken to a plate and set it aside. Wipe out the skillet/give it a quick rinse if there's a lot of extra grease (no need to wash it unless you really want to). Add in the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter, the cream cheese, cream, chicken broth, and garlic. Return the pan to the burner over medium heat. Once the butter has melted and the pan has heated up, use your spoon to help the cream cheese melt into the sauce. This will take a couple of minutes. When the cream cheese has been incorporated into the sauce, let it gently bubble for 5 minutes until the sauce has reduced somewhat. You can give it the occasional stir. Slice the chicken into bite-size strips while it's cooking. Stir the parmesan into the sauce. Let it cook for about a minute. The sauce should be thick enough by now, but if you want to reduce it further, let it cook for a little longer. If at any point the sauce gets too thick, simply add a splash of the hot pasta water to it. Give it a taste and season with salt & pepper as needed. Drain the fettuccine and add it to the skillet and toss with the sauce. Dish it up with the chicken on top (or mix it in) and grate on more parmesan cheese as desired.  I do not recommend subbing the heavy cream for anything. Alfredo sauce can easily separate if you’re making it with milk or something with a lower fat content.

Rich and velvety with loads of mushrooms, garlic, shallots, a little parmesan, and a lighter silky-smooth sauce. Grab the tips and watch my video below. A skillet with pasta and mushrooms, finished with parsley Mushroom pasta for mushroom lovers If you’re a serious mushroom lover, this recipe is calling your name. There is not a drop of heavy cream in this mushroom pasta goodness, but no one will even miss it! This pasta dinner is every bit as comforting and it plays up the earthy, umami taste of mushrooms in the best way possible! The secret to the best mushroom pasta The key to this savory, rich mushroom pasta lies in the perfect 3:1 mushroom to pasta ratio. Yes, you read this correctly, you will be using three times the amount of mushrooms to the amount of pasta in this recipe. And for lots of earthiness and depth of flavor, I use three kinds of mushrooms: white buttons, baby bella, and meaty portobello mushrooms. Like I said in the video below, it will feel like we are using a mount of mushrooms but they will cook down in your pan to the perfect amount you need for an appropriately mushroomy pasta. The flavors from a bit of garlic, shallots, and piney rosemary are the perfect complement to the earthiness of mushrooms. And a simple sauce that relies on extra virgin olive oil, a splash of red wine, and a bit of the pasta starchy water is all you need (I will tell you a bit more about the sauce later). In most recipes, the finishing touches are optional, but I highly recommend you do not skip the Parmesan and chopped walnuts. pasta with mushrooms served on plate How to cook mushrooms Cooking mushrooms for pasta is simple. My preferred method is to sauté the mushroom. Here are a few tips to keep in mind when sautéing mushrooms: Make sure the mushrooms are dry before you start. To clean off the dirt, use a lightly damp paper towel to wipe the mushrooms clean. If you wash them or submerge them in water, they will absorb water like a sponge and the final result will be squeaky mushrooms, not the texture you want. Do not slice them too thinly. You want the mushrooms to hold their shape, and if you slice them too thinly, as they cook they will shrivel down to nothing. In this recipe, I do use three kinds of mushrooms: white buttons, baby bella, and large portobello mushrooms. The white buttons and baby bellas should not be sliced no thinner than 1/4 inch (closer to 1/2 inch in thickness is good). And for the portobello mushrooms, chop them roughly to bite size pieces but do not mince them or chop them too finely. Use a combination of extra virgin olive oil and just a little bit of butter to sauté the mushrooms. In this recipe I started with 1/3 cup of extra virgin olive oil and 1 tablespoon of butter to cook a good pound and half of mushrooms with a bit of onions and garlic. If you use butter only, you will end up using too much butter because the bottom layer of the mushrooms will drink it up quickly, leaving the rest of the mushrooms dry. Allow them to cook for a little while then you can add another drizzle of olive oil. Season the mushrooms. Once in the pan, give the mushrooms a good toss in the hot pan and cook briefly, then season. A good pinch of kosher salt helps coax out the moisture for savory and tender mushrooms. You can add other spices at this point too, I added some black peppers and rosemary. The starchy pasta water makes the sauce! A typical pasta with mushrooms would involve a heavy cream-based sauce that you would likely cook separately and then spoon all over the pasta. I find that often times, the creamy sauce drowns the pasta and mutes the natural taste and richness of the mushrooms. That is why I personally prefer my sauce without cream. Making a hearty garlic mushroom pasta without cream or too much butter is fairly simple. The secret ingredient is: A little of the starchy pasta water! Don’t underestimate that little bit of the pasta cooking water. It’s the key ingredient in this recipe and also this delicious Vegetarian Carbonara with Smoky Cremini Mushrooms. A small amount of the starchy pasta water acts as a thickener, and with just a bit of cooking fat (mostly olive oil), shallots and garlic, and a little red wine and tomato paste for umami, it creates a silky sauce for this pasta, eliminating the need for heavy cream. And it helps to finish with a bit of freshly grated Parmigiano reggiano. For best results, I like to use a pasta that is short and has some textured ridges to hold on to the sauce and grated cheese. Ingredients including pasta, mushrooms, grated cheese, parsley, shallots, walnuts, and tomato paste How to make mushroom pasta This mushroom and pasta recipe is an easy one with two main components: the pasta and the mushroom sauce. Once you cook the pasta and sauté the mushrooms, everything will come together with a light sauce in one pan. For my visually inclined friends, here is how this recipe goes (friendly recipe with ingredient measurements below): Cook the pasta Get you water boiling in a large pot and make sure you salt it very well. Follow the pasta package instructions to cook the pasta to al dante. Mine took 9 to 10 minutes. Before you drain the pasta, make sure to reserve at least 1 cup of the starchy pasta cooking water for later use. Drain the pasta well. Mushrooms sautéed in cast iron skillet Make the mushroom sauce Use a large pan or a well-seasoned cast iron skillet here. Start by sautéing chopped shallots and minced garlic in a good bit of extra virgin olive oil (I used 1/3 cup) and just a little bit of butter (1 tablespoon is all you need). Add your mushrooms (it will look like a big mountain of mushrooms in your skillet, but do not worry, they will cook down nicely. Toss the mushrooms around to coat and season them with kosher salt, a little black pepper and some rosemary. Once the mushrooms release their juices and gain some good color, add tomato paste, red wine, and about ½ to 3/4 cup of the pasta cooking water. Cook over medium heat for about 4 minutes, and your gorgeous sauce is ready! Mushrooms cooked in cast iron skillet Put the pasta together Now, combine the pasta and the mushrooms in your large pan. Toss well to make sure the pasta is coated. Grate some Parmesan on top and finish with a handful of fresh parsley, crushed walnuts (the walnuts add some great texture and a nutty flavor). For a little heat, add some crushed red pepper flakes, but that is totally optional.

Butter: I recommend unsalted butter so that you can adjust the salt content yourself. But feel free to use salted and just reduce the added salt in the recipe. Heavy Cream: This forms the base of this luxurious sauce. For a lighter option, you can substitute half-and-half, but the richness and thickness of the sauce will be reduced. Parmesan Cheese: Freshly grated parmesan cheese melts the best and gives you the silkiest sauce. If you don’t want to grate the cheese yourself, choose a high-quality pre-grated cheese. Spaghetti Noodles: Cooking to al dente and then finishing in the sauce itself gives you perfectly cooked spaghetti. White Pepper: This has a slightly more mild flavor than black pepper, and won’t give you black flecks in your sauce. But, you can replace with black pepper and even add some red pepper flakes for more heat. 🥣 Step-by-Step  Bring a large pot of water to boil and salt generously. large skillet with shallots and garlic sautéed in butter.

Take some away, add extra ones in – you do you, boo. ingredients for one pot pasta arranged in cooking pan before cooking on marble background HOW TO MAKE ONE-POT PASTA The secret to success in one pot pasta is cooking the dry pasta with just the right amount of water in order for the noodles to cook completely – without leaving any extra liquid behind.

Longer noodles are harder to stir and tend to stick together more while they cook. Shorter noodles can be stirred immediately (which is important) and and often as needed – no need to wait until they soften. If you do opt for gluten-free noodles, I have found that brown rice pasta seems to work the best, followed by other corn + grain blends. Bean and lentil-based pastas fall apart in one pot recipes and release more starch, which leads to a gummier final product. bowl of cooked one pot pasta next to pan of pasta on marble background I LOVE this One-Pot Pasta recipe because it’s fuss-free, easy, and downright delicious! I personally think that one-pot noodles taste better too. Because they’re simmering in our actual sauce (and with our veggies) instead of just pasta water, they have at least double the flavor! I also like how the pasta releases a little starch as it cooks, which helps to make our sauce nice, thick, and creamy.

Author: Caitlin Shoemaker Prep Time: 5 Minutes Cook Time: 15 Minutes Total Time: 20 minutes  Serves 2 to 4 1x Category: Main Method: Stovetop Cuisine: American Ingredients Scale 8 ounces dry pasta*, gluten-free or regular 8 ounces grape or cherry tomatoes, cut in half 2 garlic cloves, minced 1/2 yellow onion, thinly sliced 1 small zucchini, chopped and quartered 3 oz cremini mushrooms, sliced 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional) 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 1 1/4 cup pasta sauce of choice 2 1/2 cups water 3 ounces fresh spinach  Add the uncooked pasta to a large pot (or pan with deep sides). Add the remaining ingredients – except for the spinach – and mix well. Bring the pot to a boil over high heat. Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium low and cook the pasta for 10-14 minutes, until al-dente. Stir the mixture every 2 minutes to prevent anything from sticking to the bottom of the pan. (Note: cooking times will vary based on the type of pasta used. I suggest you start to check for doneness based on the minimum cook time on the package instructions) Turn the heat off and fold the spinach into the pasta. Once the spinach has wilted, divide the pasta into serving bowls and top as desired. This recipe is best enjoyed fresh, but leftovers will keep in the fridge for up to 5 days.  Pasta: this recipe will work both gluten-free and gluten-full pasta, so use what works for you! I suggest you use shorter pasta shapes (such as penne, rotini, shells, marcaroni) over longer noodles as they cook more evenly in this method. If you are using gluten-free pasta, I have found that brown rice pasta works best. Vegetables: feel free to add, subtract, or substitute any of the veggies here! Did you make this recipe?

With bright, bold flavor, it's one of our favorite weeknight dinners. pesto pasta recipe in a skillet The first snow came early in Chicago this year. It was barely November and we were driving to an appointment. It was snowing, and then all of a sudden it went from “really charming” to “wow it’s really coming down!” We sat in the cold car way too long, wearing way too-light coats, staring at brake lights and a grey sky. I thought – really – what have we done?? I write a blog about vegetables, I’m shooting a book that’s due before May (when the spring farmers markets open) and we’ve moved so far from the sun! We got to where we were going – an industrial area in the Pullman neighborhood where, situated on the roof of the Method production facility, is Gotham Greens. I’ve been obsessed with their locally grown greens since the moment I came across their deliciously spicy arugula earlier this year. We got a tour of their rooftop greenhouse, and even though it was cold and miserable outside, it was so warm and sunny up there. There was a sea of the softest butter lettuces, my favorite spicy arugula, and the loveliest scent of fresh basil. gotham greens basil Later that night, with a fridge full of greens and a pantry full of not much else, I made my go-to quick & easy dinner: this five minute pesto pasta. We weren’t about to head out into the snow for any additional groceries, and really, nothing beats pasta in terms of combining bold flavor and easy prep. How to Make Pesto Pasta As I said above, making pesto pasta is easy. Here’s all you need to do: Blend up a batch of my 6-ingredient basil pesto, or use store-bought pesto in a pinch. Cook your pasta in a large pot of salted boiling water according to the package directions. Before draining the pasta, reserve some of the starchy pasta water. Then, add 1/4 cup of this pasta water back into the pot with your pesto, and stir to thin the pesto. Toss in the cooked pasta, and mix until the pesto thoroughly coats it. Add a big handful of arugula and toss until it’s barely wilted. Finish everything with a big squeeze of lemon, salt, pepper, red pepper flakes, and toasted pine nuts. Dig in! basil pesto in a food processor for pesto sauce pasta Pesto Pasta Recipe Tips Never made pesto pasta before? Here are a few tips to get you started: Reserve some pasta water. My #1 pesto pasta tip! The salty, starchy pasta water will loosen the pesto enough to make a light sauce over the pasta. Because of its salty, starchy quality, this water will make a more flavorful, thicker final pesto sauce than regular water would. Add the greens at the last minute. I like my greens to be just slightly wilted, not totally limp. Toss them in at the last minute so that the hot pasta can wilt them, and then serve right away, while they still have a little crunch and vibrant color. Taste and adjust. Pestos vary in brightness, saltiness, and overall intensity of flavor, so make sure you taste and adjust your final dish before serving. Depending on your pesto, you might need to add an extra squeeze of lemon, a pinch of salt, or a big grind of black pepper to make your pesto pasta sing. pesto pasta with arugula on plates Pesto Pasta Recipe Variations Like all simple recipes, this one’s fun to play with. Here are a few ideas to change it up: No pine nuts on hand? Use walnuts or almonds instead. Finish the dish with spinach or kale in place of arugula, or skip the greens altogether. Try using kale pesto instead of basil for a cold weather variation. Garnish the final dish with a few fresh or roasted cherry tomatoes, roasted cauliflower, or asparagus. Stir in some mini mozzarella balls or a sprinkle of capers. Swap the spaghetti for your favorite pasta shape, or use spaghetti squash in its place. What’s your favorite way to eat pesto pasta?

Quick, easy, hearty, and so delicious! Pan-seared Italian seasoned chicken in a creamy Italian chili sauce with sun-dried tomatoes and spinach. Cooked together with rigatoni pasta for a quick dinner made in one pot. Truly one of those all-in-one dinners that everyone at the table will love. Elegant enough for a special holiday dinner yet equally great to make at the end of a busy day. You can’t go wrong with this chicken pasta recipe. Spicy Tuscan Chicken Pasta| halfbakedharvest.com Growing up, Valentine’s Day was definitely more of a holiday celebrated at school than at home. In our house, a house full of boys, no one cared much for Valentine’s Day. Even my mom, who you’d think might have some interest, does not care for the holiday. My dad refers to it as a “Hallmark Holiday“. But there was one person in my life who always made Valentine’s Day special, my Nonnie. No matter where she was, Florida or Cleveland, she’d send us a small gift for V-Day every year. She always made it special and fun. Spicy Tuscan Chicken Pasta| halfbakedharvest.com I can’t say that Valentine’s Day is my favorite day of the year, but I honestly find the holiday of love to be very sweet. I love any excuse to bake chocolate and make a yummy dinner that feels super special. On Friday, I shared what I’ll be making for my Valentine’s Day dessert. With today’s pasta dish we now have a full Valentine’s Day meal (I do have another fun dessert coming tomorrow too!) And if where you live is as booked up for dinner reservations as it is here in New York, you’re going to want to stay in and cook!! And this creamy chicken pasta, which also happens to be super easy, is just perfect. Spicy Tuscan Chicken Pasta| halfbakedharvest.com Here are details I mentioned last week sometime that I’ve really been enjoying cooking with Italian jarred Calabrian chili paste. I’m finding it so delicious and a great way to add a small amount of spice and flavor to my Italian-inspired dishes. I wanted to make a red pasta for Valentine’s Day that was not tomato based. It’s funny, this is actually a request I get often. Apparently, not everyone enjoys a tomato heavy pasta. Spicy Tuscan Chicken Pasta| halfbakedharvest.com You’ll want to start with sun-dried tomatoes in olive oil. Yes, these are tomatoes, but they’re stirred, and so different than fresh or canned. I love them so much. Drain the oil and save that for cooking. Then chop the tomatoes. Now add the chicken, I used breasts but you could also use chicken thighs and Italian seasoning to a big pot that will also fit your pasta. Cook the chicken until browned, then add a bit of parmesan cheese. The cheese melts on the chicken, then turns crispy. Once you’ve cooked the chicken, add the chilies and other spices/seasonings into the pot with some oil. Let that cook for a minute, then add water or chicken broth to the pot and bring it to a boil. Now add the pasta and let the pasta cook until it’s al dente. I like to use rigatoni, but penne pasta is also great. At this point, all you need to do is add some milk or cream and a handful of spinach. Then more parmesan and mix, mix, mix. Spicy Tuscan Chicken Pasta| halfbakedharvest.com As soon as the cheese melts. Serve the pasta directly from the pot with fresh basil on top. It’s going to smell and look incredible, so you’ll want to eat it all up right away! I recommend some soft bread on the side like a garlic roll or maybe beer bread. A crusty no-knead bread could also be delicious. Then a big Caesar-style salad would be great as well! Super elegant, even romantic meal, right? It could be wonderful for tomorrow night! Hope you all enjoy this as much as I do! Leftovers are great stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator. Spicy Tuscan Chicken Pasta| halfbakedharvest.com Looking for winter pasta recipes?

        "text": "Easy Breakfast Casserole Use whatever you have on hand to make it. On vacation, having too much fun to realize that nothing has been planned for meals, fridge mostly empty, remembering that uh-oh, I'm the one in charge of feeding my friend's children that day. Oops! Open the refrigerator door, see half a dozen eggs, half a carton of milk, some cheddar cheese, leftover sausage from biscuits and gravy the day before, a little broccoli, a leftover ear of corn (cooked). Open the freezer and see half a loaf of sliced bread. Saved! Whew. I won't have to reach for the boxed mac and cheese. Side shot of finished breakfast casserole in a glass baking pan Simply Recipes / Elise Bauer What's the Base of This Breakfast Casserole? Have you ever made a breakfast casserole? The basic ingredients are eggs, cheese, milk, and bread. It's the easiest thing in the world to put together. We have a sausage breakfast casserole on the site that is one of my favorites. Open Fridge Breakfast Bake The great thing about a breakfast casserole is that you can add almost anything you want to the base. Italian sausage is my all-time favorite, but bacon or ham will do, too. Or make it veggie with zucchini, broccoli, basil, and onions. The first time I served this to the kids they insisted that it had to go on the website. The name they picked was Open Fridge Breakfast Bake because basically that's what I did—opened the fridge, put everything I could find into a casserole dish, and baked it. Overhead shot of the finished breakfast casserole in a 9x13 baking dish Simply Recipes / Elise Bauer How to Make a Breakfast Casserole To make a breakfast casserole you beat some eggs, add milk and cheese, add cubed bread, add mix-ins like mushrooms, veggies, sausage, and herbs, put it in a casserole dish, and bake. Easy, right? The ingredients basically all come together in one big casserole pan, but there are a few steps I would recommend first: If you are using a lot of mushrooms, sauté them a bit beforehand to release some of their moisture. You can add cooked, sturdy veggies such as broccoli into the casserole, or put them in raw. If using raw veggies, cut them into smaller pieces and know that they'll be crunchier if you put them in raw instead of cooked. If you are adding sausage or bacon, cook it first before adding it to the casserole. The proportions of ingredients are adjustable. If you add more eggs, it will result in a casserole that is more firm and less likely to deflate. Day-old or stale bread works best for a breakfast casserole, but if you don't have any, just leave slices of fresh bread out on the counter to dry for a few hours, or put the slices in a low oven (200°F, 10 min) or toaster for a minute (just enough to dry them a little). What to Serve With a Breakfast Casserole Breakfast casserole is truly a meal in itself! It has starch (bread), milk, cheese, meat, and vegetables. It can be made for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Serve it with some sliced fresh fruit on the side for breakfast, or if making for dinner, a green salad. If you omit the veggies in the casserole, consider serving some sautéed vegetables on the side. Or if leaving out the meat, some crispy bacon or cooked sausages. Make Ahead  Breakfast casseroles are almost designed to be made ahead. You can assemble the whole thing the night before, put it in the fridge (covered), and bake it the next morning. It's minimal work when you wake up and a low stress breakfast if you have a group of people to feed.

Some people wonder if scrambled eggs are healthy. In the past, eggs got a bad rap for being high in cholesterol so people thought they shouldnt eat too many eggs if they were following a heart healthy diet, but eggs are a great source of heart healthy protein and can often be included in a heart healthy diet. One egg contains 6g of protein, as well as heart healthy nutrients like potassium, folate and B vitamins. Egg whites contain less protein (3.6g) but also have less fat, cholesterol and calories. If you have heart disease, your doctor may recommend limiting the amount of whole eggs you eat, but many people can eat eggs in moderation as part of a healthy diet or can eat egg whites if they prefer. How to Make Healthy Scrambled Eggs What you put in your scrambled eggs can make or break the healthfulness of otherwise healthy eggs. If you use a lot of butter or add whole milk, cream or cheese, it adds a lot of fat to the dish. Seasoning the eggs with salt adds sodium. Our heart healthy scrambled eggs are made from egg whites, are mixed with skim milk and contain no salt.

What You Need to Make Healthy Deviled Eggs This healthy deviled egg recipe uses the same pantry staples as the traditional dish with a couple of fun twists. Greek yogurt replaces the mayo, and capers give a burst of bright flavor to balance the creaminess. This recipe is super versatile: feel free to experiment with the seasonings and garnishes you love most. Large eggs: Large eggs are easier to work with, as they have a larger cavity. You can substitute with whatever eggs you have on hand. Smaller eggs just may require more finesse! Greek yogurt: Greek yogurt replaces the mayo for a healthier version of deviled eggs. I like whole milk Greek yogurt for added richness and flavor, but low-fat or nonfat can also be used. Dijon mustard: Dijon mustard gives these deviled eggs a bold peppery kick. Whole grain or smooth will both work, it all comes down to your personal preference. If you like pops of mustard seed, use whole grain. If you like a super smooth deviled egg, use smooth! Kosher salt: Salt is an important component of most every dish, but especially eggs. You need a good pinch of salt to bring out all the flavor. Garlic powder: Garlic powder adds a sweet-meets-savory allium flavor to the deviled eggs without the harshness of fresh garlic. If you need to substitute, you can use onion powder instead. I would not substitute with fresh garlic here unless youre in a very serious bind. It will be too strong and interfere with the deviled eggs texture. Chives: Chives are used as a garnish to add freshness and a pop of color. Paprika: A dusting of paprika seasons the dish and gives deviled eggs their famous look. Both sweet Spanish paprika or smoked Spanish paprika work depending on your preference (use smoked for a bolder flavor). Capers (optional): Capers are my Mediterranean twist on this deviled egg recipe. They give bright bursts of flavor, making the eggs less one-note and balancing their richness. If you dont like capers, you can substitute them with finely diced cornichons, pickles, or leave them off. How to Make Healthy Deviled Eggs Deviled eggs, with their pretty presentation, seem like a fancy restaurant-only dish. The secret is that theyre so easy to make! All you need to do is boil some eggs, scoop, mix, and fill. Hard boil the eggs: In the bottom of a medium saucepan, carefully arrange the eggs in one single layer.

To easily peel eggs (in the hopes of keeping them somewhat intact), roll on a hard surface to crack all over. Peel carefully and take your time.

Try these low sodium breakfast sliders with eggs, homemade breakfast sausage, and cheese. I recently realized that I dont have many breakfast recipes up on the blog, so I have decided to try and change that. We typically stick to pretty simple breakfast fare – eggs and toast (made from Favorite White Bread, naturally), scrambled eggs with all sorts of yummies thrown in, yogurt with fruit, and so on. But that doesnt mean that I cant share those simple ideas with you. And then there are more complex breakfast things that I would love to share like biscuits and gravy or corned beef hash. Low Sodium Breakfast Sliders Ive also been playing with slider recipes, born of my discover that Kings Hawaiian Rolls are relatively low in sodium. Ive made several different variations since I first posted the Game Day Beef Sliders. Between my slider craze and the lack of breakfast recipes on the blog, this recipe for breakfast sliders was born. It is fairly straightforward – homemade breakfast sausage (ground pork with spices) and scrambled eggs piled on rolls and topped with cheese. They hold up well in the fridge for several days; we just reheat what we want by wrapping in foil and baking for 15-20 minutes.

In a small bowl, combine the dried onion with the water and set aside. Combine the ground pork, sage, thyme, black pepper, and crushed red pepper in large skillet over medium heat and cook until the meat is no longer pink. Remove the meat form the pan onto a plate lined with a paper towel. While the meat is cooking, whisk together the eggs and milk. Once youve removed the meat from the skillet, add the eggs and the onions to the pan and cook slowly over medium low heat. Continue to cook until the eggs are about half way cooked (7-10 minutes). I posted some pictures below this recipe to show what I mean by half way cooked. Add the meat back into the pan with the eggs. Continue to cook until the scrambled eggs are cooked to your desired consistency. Line a baking sheet with a large sheet of tin foil. (You will wrap the sliders in the tin foil, so make sure it is a long enough sheet to enclose them.) Cut the Hawaiian rolls open and place the bottom half of the rolls onto the tin foil. Evenly spread the egg mixture across the bottom half of the buns. Lay the slices of swiss cheese across the egg mixture and put the top of the rolls on top of the meat. I posted pictures of the assembly below the recipe for reference. In a small bowl, combine the melted butter and maple syrup. Spread the mixture on top of the rolls. Close the tin foil over the rolls and bake in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes. Remove the rolls from the oven and pull back the tin foil so that the tops of the rolls are exposed. Put the rolls back in the oven and bake for 5 more minutes, or until the tops have browned. Remove the sliders from the oven and enjoy!

Ingredients to make This healthy egg salad Eggs: Hard-boiled eggs provide a rich and velvety texture and pack in a protein punch. They also absorb the flavors of the dressing, resulting in a well-balanced overall flavor. Celery: Adds a satisfying crunch and a refreshing, slightly earthy flavor to the salad. Greek yogurt: Plain Greek yogurt is a healthier alternative to mayonnaise, offering a creamy consistency and tangy flavor. It also helps to bump up the protein content. Dijon mustard: Adds a tangy and slightly spicy flavor that complements the eggs and yogurt. Lemon zest: Provides a bright and refreshing citrusy flavor that cuts through the richness of the eggs. Learn how to zest a lemon. Salt and black pepper: Enhances the flavors of all ingredients, bringing balance and seasoning to the salad. Parsley: Fresh parsley brings a fresh taste and herbal aroma to the boiled egg salad. Cutting board with chefs knife and chopped eggs on chopping board How to make a healthy egg salad The first step to making a healthy egg salad is to first make hard-boiled eggs. Here are 4 great ways to do that: Option a) is to cook the eggs on a stovetop. Learn all the tips and tricks on how to boil eggs on stovetop. Option b) is to cook them in your Instant Pot by placing the eggs on a trivet. Learn how to make Instant Pot hard boiled eggs. Option c) is to bake eggs in the oven for 25 minutes at 325°F. Option d) is to air fry the eggs, this happens to be my favorite method. Once your eggs are cooked and cooled, peel them and roughly chop them. Next, continue with the rest of the recipe: Add Greek yogurt, Dijon mustard, lemon zest, salt, and pepper to a large bowl. Whisk together until fully combined. You can adjust the seasoning if needed. Add the chopped eggs, celery, and parsley on top of the dressing. Toss together until fully combined. Large clear bowl on marble with greek yogurt, dijon mustard and lemon zest. Next to the bowl Tips for making the best boiled egg salad Dont skip the ice bath for the eggs. When making hard boiled eggs, shock them in an ice bath immediately after they are cooked. This stops the boiling process right away and makes the peeling so much easier. Use whole milk, plain Greek yogurt. Because youre substituting the yogurt for mayonnaise, the extra creaminess from the whole milk yogurt compared to a leaner variety will help to thicken the dressing, making it more creamy and rich. Go easy on the stirring. Avoid over-stirring the egg salad to prevent it from turning to mush and looking like baby food. When you add the chopped eggs to the dressing, fold just enough to coat all the ingredients while still keeping the boiled egg salad chunky. POPULAR SUBSTITUTIONS & ADDITIONS Switch up the protein: While this recipe uses hard-boiled eggs, you could also try it with tofu for a vegan option or diced, cooked chicken for a different protein punch. Change the greens: If youre not a fan of celery or parsley, try other crunchy vegetables like diced bell pepper or cucumbers. For herbs, dill or chives could be a great replacement for parsley, adding a different layer of flavor. Try a different dairy: While Greek yogurt provides a tangy creaminess, you could substitute it with sour cream or a non-dairy yogurt alternative to cater to different dietary needs or preferences. Boost it with grains: To make this salad even more filling, consider adding some cooked quinoa, farro, or even chickpeas. These will add not only texture but also extra nutritional benefits. Add some heat: If you like a bit of a kick, add in some chopped jalapenos or a sprinkle of red pepper flakes. You could also try a dash of hot sauce or even some wasabi for a unique twist. Cheese, please: For an extra layer of creaminess and flavor, try adding a sprinkle of shredded cheddar, crumbled feta, or diced avocado. Go nuts with toppings: Sprinkle on some toasted almond slivers, sunflower seeds, or even some crunchy pumpkin seeds for an added layer of texture. For a refreshing touch, finish it off with a bit of lemon or lime zest. How to serve egg salad Sandwich. Spread the healthy egg salad on everything bagel or between two slices of bread. Lettuce cups.

The trick is to cook them in hot olive oil so they develop irresistible lacy edges and lots of flavor. You can cook 1 to 2 eggs at a time in a skillet. Ingredients 1x 2x 3x 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 1 egg  Cooking 1 egg? Pull out a small skillet, preferably cast iron. Cooking 2 eggs? Use a medium-to-large skillet and use 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Crack an egg into a small bowl or ramekin and place it near the stove. Warm your skillet over medium-high heat until its hot enough that a drop of water sizzles rapidly on contact. Reduce the heat to medium and add the olive oil to the pan. Gently tilt the pan around so the olive oil covers the base of the pan. The olive oil should be so warm that it shimmers on the pan (if not, give it a little more time to warm up). Carefully pour the egg into the skillet and watch out for hot oil splatters (if youre planning to add another egg to the same pan, pour it onto the side so theres room for another). Let the egg cook, gently tilting the pan occasionally to redistribute the oil, until the edges are crisp and golden and the yolk is cooked to your liking, about 2 minutes for runny yolks or 2 ½ to 3 minutes for medium yolks. (If youre adding another egg to the skillet, go ahead and do it while the other is cooking.) Transfer the cooked egg(s) to a plate. If youd like to cook more eggs in the same skillet, add another drizzle of olive oil, leave the heat at medium (you might even need to dial it down a bit to avoid smoking) and add your next egg. Repeat as necessary.  SEASONING SUGGESTIONS: I love a sprinkle of flaky sea salt, freshly ground black pepper, and sometimes a splash of hot sauce.",

This recipe is an amazing vegetarian dinner! Recipe yields 4 hearty bowls or 6 medium bowls. Ingredients 1x 2x 3x Bell peppers and onion 3 bell peppers (red, orange or yellow) 1 medium red onion 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 teaspoon chili powder ½ teaspoon cumin ½ teaspoon garlic powder ¼ teaspoon fine salt 10 twists of freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons lime juice Halloumi ½ pound or more* halloumi cheese ½ tablespoon olive oil ¼ teaspoon chipotle powder or smoked paprika (optional, for heat) Rice, beans, and toppings 1 cup long-grain brown rice or brown basmati rice, rinsed well 2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro 2 tablespoons lime juice ½ teaspoon fine salt 1 can (15 ounces) black beans, rinsed and drained, or 1 ½ cups cooked black beans Topping suggestions: Fresh cilantro, sliced avocado or dollops of guacamole, halved cherry tomatoes, sour cream  Preheat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit. Line two large, rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper. Bring a large pot of water to boil over high heat for the rice. Slice the peppers and onion into ½-inch wide long strips, keeping the chunks of onion intact as best you can. Place the peppers and onion on one prepared baking sheet. Drizzle them with the olive oil, chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, salt and pepper (save the lime juice for later). Toss until all of the ingredients are lightly coated, then arrange them in an even layer across the pan. Rearrange any single onion pieces from the outer edges to the interior of the pan, as they tend to burn otherwise. Bake the peppers and onions on the middle rack for 15 minutes. Once the pot of water is boiling, pour in the rice. Give the mixture a brief stir and let it boil for 30 minutes, reducing the heat if necessary to prevent overflow. Drain the rice, return it to the pot, cover, and let it rest for 10 minutes off the heat. Meanwhile, lightly pat the halloumi dry. Slice the halloumi lengthwise into pieces ¼ to ½ inch thick, then cut or tear the slabs into small, bite-sized pieces about 1-inch long. On the remaining baking sheet, drizzle the halloumi with ½ tablespoon olive oil and sprinkle all over with the optional chipotle powder. Toss until lightly coated, and arrange them in an even layer. Once the timer goes off for the peppers, remove them from the oven, stir and redistribute. Again move any single onion pieces to the middle, then return the baking sheet to the oven. When you do that, place the pan of halloumi on the top rack. After 10 minutes, stir and flip the cheese, moving any browning pieces more toward the middle. Return it to the oven for up to 5 more minutes, keeping a close eye on it as the cheese tends to brown quickly toward the end. Continue baking the pepper mixture until the peppers and onions are tender and deeply caramelized. They are typically done around the time that the halloumi is finished. While the peppers are hot out of the oven, drizzle the lime juice on top and stir to combine. Season to taste with additional salt and pepper. To finish the rice, fluff it with a fork, then stir in the cilantro, lime juice, and salt. Add the black beans and gently stir to combine. Cover until youre ready to serve. To assemble, divide the rice between four bowls, followed by the pepper mixture and cheese. Finish with any desired toppings, and enjoy warm. Leftovers keep well in the refrigerator, covered, for up to 4 days.  *HALLOUMI QUANTITY: The halloumi I buy is typically sold in sealed packages that are roughly ½ pound in weight. If possible, find one thats on the upper end closer to 0.6 pounds (10-ish ounces) so you have plenty of cheese. MAKE IT DAIRY FREE/VEGAN: You could omit the halloumi and double the beans for more protein. Or, while its definitely not the same thing, you would likely enjoy my baked tofu in place of the halloumi. Add chipotle powder or smoked paprika (see recipe for quantities) for some spice. For a different dairy-free option, replace the cheese with crispy fried eggs.",

Antioxidant-rich cauliflower and spinach get a flavor upgrade from earthy garlic, herby dill and sweet shallots. Briny feta cheese and funky fontina become all melty and hold everything together between two slices of nutty whole-wheat bread that get a marvelously crisp exterior from grilling on a hot skillet. Keep reading for our expert tips, including how to ensure everything cooks evenly. Tips from the EatingWell Test Kitchen These are the key tips we learned while developing and testing this recipe in our Test Kitchen to make sure it works, tastes great and is good for you too! Drain as much liquid as possible from the spinach after cooking it to prevent soggy sandwiches. If you cook the sandwiches in a skillet, place a second skillet on top to weigh them down. This will help them cook evenly by applying consistent pressure. You can use Cheddar cheese or your favorite melting cheese instead of feta and fontina. You can make this sandwich using whole-wheat pita bread instead of regular sandwich bread.   Cauliflower doesnt exactly fit the eat the rainbow motto, but that doesnt mean its not full of nutrition. It is, after all, one of the cruciferous vegetables, which are known for their disease-fighting phytonutrients. Plus cauliflower is low-carb and high in fiber, which will keep your gut happy. Spinach is a great leafy green to include in this sandwich because it holds up well to the heat. Its also packed with antioxidants that support healthy eyes and vision and is rich in bone-strengthening vitamin K. Cheese is what makes this sandwich a melt and provides that ooey-gooey factor. It also brings bone-building calcium and muscle-building protein to this sandwich. And because cheese is fermented, it adds some gut-friendly bacteria to your intestines—and those bacteria will happily nosh on the fiber in the veggies and whole-wheat bread. Whole-wheat bread makes up the foundation of this handheld meal. The fiber in it not only feeds your guts beneficial bacteria but also helps make this sandwich filling and satisfying. an image of the ingredients to make the Cauliflower Spanakopita Melt Photographer: Jen Causey, Food Stylist: Emily Nabors Hall, Prop Stylist: Lindsey Lower",

Its so easy to make, requires only 10 minutes of prep time and is completely vegan and gluten free. crispy baked sesame tofu in a bowl with broccoli and chopsticks Its no secret around here that Im a big, ok huge, fan of sesame anything. Sesame noodles, chickpeas, cauliflower, sesame chickpea meatballs, now sesame tofu?! Sesame salmon is next on my list but Im always open to suggestions! Easy dinners are my favorite kind of dinners. Easy dinners that are so flavorful are the absolute best. This baked tofu recipe is exactly that and I cannot wait for you to try it! I love to serve it up with some rice and broccoli to make a sort of buddha bowl, but you can also serve it in a stir fry or with my vegan fried rice. Tofu does not contain sesame as it is just made with soy beans, but this recipe contains sesame oil for a delicious sesame flavor. If you love this recipe, try my crispy garlic tofu, gochujang korean tofu or tofu burrito bowl next! Why youll love this recipe Vegan & gluten free Packed with flavor Crispy Easy to make ingredients in bowls with labels Tips for crispy tofu Ill admit, I totally understand why some people are so turned off by tofu. It doesnt look all that great straight out of the package, and without any sauce, it doesnt have much of a flavor. However, (and a big however!), if you know how to cook tofu properly, then you can make it taste seriously delicious. Crispy, flavorful, easy to make, high in protein… basically everything you could want. The key to baking tofu is to bake it plain and with some sort of flour or starch. Baking it without any sauce ensures the tofu on its own is able to crisp up and without burning the sauce. The flour/starch works to absorb any excess moisture to give us a super crispy exterior and soft interior. Well then coat it in the sauce after it bakes so it stays crispy! two photos showing how to make the recipe How to make sesame tofu Cut tofu. Cut a slit in the side of the tofu container and drain out all of the excess liquid. Remove the tofu from the package and wrap it in a towel just to get off as much liquid as possible without having to press the tofu. Once it seems dry, cut the tofu into 1 inch cubes.

Once the tofu is cubed, add it to a large bowl and toss with the soy sauce. Next, toss in the cornstarch then the breadcrumbs. I like to just shake the bowl so the tofu doesnt break (sometimes it breaks if you use a spoon) and toss until every piece is well coated. Bake. Add to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, and try to ensure none of the tofu pieces touch each other. I know that seems annoying, but the space between really helps it get crispy. Make sauce. Add the tofu to the oven and bake for about 30 minutes or until golden brown. While the tofu is baking, well prepare the sauce on the stove. Serve. Once the sauce and tofu are done, toss both together until well coated and enjoy! I like to serve it with brown or white rice and some steamed broccoli. angled view of the tofu in a bowl with chopsticks getting a piece Do you need to press tofu? Yes and no. You can absolutely get away with not pressing the tofu for this recipe. I dont list it in the instructions because this recipe turns out really well without any pressing. Plus, it saves a lot of time! Tofu is basically a sponge that sits in water and absorbs all of it. Pressing out the excess water does help make it more crispy and ensures it cooks evenly through the center. If youre trying to get flavors into the tofu, you do want to press it. In the case of this sesame tofu, were trying to get a crispy outside so the sauce will stick on the outside, so pressing isnt necessary. Moral of the story, nothing bad will happen if you dont press tofu, but if you want the crispiest and most flavorful tofu around, press away! How to store and reheat Once prepared, this sesame tofu will keep in the fridge for 3 days. It is best served fresh, but you can pop everything back in the oven at 200 for 10 minutes to crisp it back up. The microwave also works, but tends to make things a bit soft/soggy, but the flavor will still be delicious. sesame tofu in a bowl with broccoli and rice Youll also love..

Garnish with sesame seeds if desired and serve over rice with steamed broccoli or enjoy as is!  If you have a tofu press or extra time on your hands, definitely press the tofu, but it is not necessary for this recipe. It will make it crispier, but you can easily skip it! I always use low sodium soy sauce, if you use regular soy sauce you may want to add a bit of water to the sauce so the saltiness isnt overpowering.

Jump to: What to Serve with Sticky Sesame Tofu Extra Toppings Equipment Needed Tips for Making Sticky Sesame Tofu Batch Cook and Store Safely How to Thaw and Reheat Make it Gluten Free Sticky Sesame Tofu Recipe Other Vegan Meal Prep Recipes What to Serve with Sticky Sesame Tofu There are plenty of sides that would complete this tasty dish. One option is steamed or stir-fried vegetables. These can include broccoli, bok choy, snow peas, bell peppers, etc. You can cook these with an Asian-inspired sauce or make it simple with garlic and a splash of soy sauce to complement the tofu. If you want to add a fresh component to this meal, try serving with a side salad. This could be a simple garden salad or maybe a cucumber or avocado salad. If you want to really dive into the Asian-inspired cuisine, try pairing your tofu with a warm bowl of Miso soup. Youll forget you made this meal in your own kitchen. Extra Toppings If you want to spice up your tofu, try these toppings for extra flavor: Crushed peanuts or cashews Chili flakes or sliced red chili Fresh cilantro Pickled ginger Fried garlic or shallots Toasted nori strips (seaweed) Sliced avocado Radish slices Equipment Needed To make your Sticky Sesame Tofu, youll need the following: 2 small/medium mixing bowls Non-stick pan Spatula (to flip tofu) Tips for Making Sticky Sesame Tofu Before cutting your tofu, press it for at least 15-30 minutes to remove excess moisture—this will help it become crispier when you cook it. Opt for extra-firm tofu to ensure that it holds its shape and achieves that desired crispy texture. When adding the flour to the tofu cubes, make sure to coat thoroughly—this will help them get crispy when fried. Toss the tofu in the sticky sauce only just before serving to prevent it from getting soggy. Serve your tofu immediately so its as crispy and flavorful as possible. How to Batch Cook and Store Safely This Sticky Sesame Tofu is a great dish to meal prep so you can enjoy it throughout the week. To meal prep, start by doubling or tripling the recipe so you have plenty to put away. Cook the tofu in batches to avoid overcrowding the pan. Once its cooked, place it on a paper towel-lined plate to absorb excess oil. Cook the sauce, but do not put the tofu in it if youre planning to meal prep. Store your tofu and sauce separately to prevent the tofu from getting soggy. You can store the tofu in the fridge in an airtight container lined with paper towels to absorb extra moisture. It will keep for 3-4 days. Store the sauce in the fridge as well in a separate container—it will keep for up to a week. For long-term storage, you can freeze the tofu and sauce separately. To freeze, lay the tofu cubes on a baking sheet to freeze individually before transferring them to a freezer-safe bag or container. Theyll keep in the freezer for up to 2-3 months. The sauce can also be frozen in a freezer-safe container or ice cube trays for portion control and will last for up to 2-3 months. How to Thaw and Reheat To reheat the tofu, place it in the oven at 350°F (175°C) for about 10-15 minutes, or until heated through and crispy. You can also reheat it in a pan with a small amount of oil to regain some of the crispiness. Reheat the sauce in a small saucepan over low heat until warmed through. Then simply toss the reheated tofu in the warmed sauce just before serving to maintain the crispy texture. Make it Gluten Free To make this recipe gluten-free, simply swap the soy sauce for gluten-free soy sauce, and ensure your chili sauce, ketchup, and rice wine vinegar are gluten-free—they should have a gluten-free label on their bottles. Sticky Sesame Tofu Recipe Servings: 2 Prep time: 25-30 minutes Cook time: 20 minutes Ingredients Crispy Tofu: 1 block firm tofu Salt and pepper to taste 25 grams corn flour 2 tbsp soy sauce 1 tbsp coconut oil Sticky Sauce: 2 tbsp soy sauce 3 tbsp sweet chili sauce 2 tbsp agave syrup 2 tbsp tomato ketchup 2 garlic cloves, crushed 1 tbsp rice wine vinegar 1 tsp garlic granules 1 tsp corn flour  First, dice the tofu into 2cm cubes and season it generously with salt and pepper. Transfer the diced tofu to your bowl filled with soy sauce and toss until all pieces are coated. Then, transfer the tofu pieces into your bowl filled with corn flour, toss until completely coated, and set aside. Mix all of the sticky sauce ingredients together (apart from the corn flour mixture) and set it aside. Heat the coconut oil in a non-stick pan and add your coated tofu pieces. Cook for 4-5 minutes on a medium heat (the oil should be sizzling slightly). Check that the tofu pieces are golden and crispy on the cooked side before flipping and cooking the other side until golden and crispy. Once cooked, remove the tofu from the pan and set aside. Give your pan a quick clean with a paper towel and add the sticky sauce. Bring the sauce to a low simmer and cook for 5 minutes. Add the corn flour mixture and stir well. Bring to a simmer once more and cook until the sauce thickens, this should take 3-4 minutes. Add your crispy tofu back to the pan and toss in the sticky sauce. Careful not to leave tofu in the pan for too long or it will lose its crispiness.",

It sits perfectly in the venn diagram of easy, wholesome, and tasty. While I typically spread it on some whole wheat toast for quick but filling breakfast, theres no need to stop there. It would make for a terrific topping on a salad or grain bowl, too! Why youll love this recipe Incredibly simple. With just a few ingredients and a food processor, you can prepare this dish in less than 10 minutes. How easy is that? Crazy flavorful. Simple though it may be, this recipe is anything but boring. Creamy, rich and nutty with bold garlicky and slightly spicy flavors, I find it hard to believe anyone wouldnt like this edamame spread. Lime juice and zest add a zingy, citrus-y brightness that will keep you coming back for more. Breakfast for the week. This recipe makes a generous four servings. Make a batch on Monday morning and youll have breakfast for almost the entire week. The shelf life is great, too, so you could even eat it the following weekend. Customize to your liking. Delicious on its own, this recipe is also easy to customize with some creative toppings. Sauerkraut is a great source of probiotics for gut health, while pickled onions provide a delightful tang. You can add hemp seeds or thinly sliced tofu for even more protein. And if you have any microgeens or thinly sliced salad greens hanging around your fridge, theyd be terrific on top, too. Protein sources in this recipe There are three elements to this recipe and each contributes a significant amount of protein. First, the edamame mash itself. Edamame is a protein powerhouse, contributing about 10 grams of protein per serving. Tahini is an underrated protein source; here, it adds about 3 grams of protein per serving. Finally, the half avocado adds about 1 gram of protein per serving. Next is the multigrain bread. The precise amount of protein will vary by brand, but the brand I used (Silver Hills Bakery Hemptation) contains a whopping 6 grams of protein per slice, or 12 grams of protein in total. Daves Killer Bread is another good option. Finally, hemp seeds are a fantastic protein source. Sprinkle them on sandwiches or salads for an extra protein boost. Here, they add about 5 grams of protein per serving. Interested in more delicious edamame recipes? Make my easy Garlicky Sesame Edamame Salad!

Youll love the fresh filling in these enchiladas, made of sautéed bell pepper, broccoli, onion, spinach, black beans and warming spices. These enchiladas are nicely cheesy, but not overwhelmingly cheesy like many restaurants make them. vegetarian enchilada ingredients This enchilada recipe has become quite popular since I published it nearly eight years ago. I used my as a blueprint and covered them with my , of course. Theyre just fantastic and I hope youll give them a try, if you havent already. If youve never made enchiladas before, you can do it!

Heres a basic rundown with some notes and variations. Youll start by making my , a simple, pantry-friendly recipe using dried spices and vegetable broth. It has an amazing depth of flavor! If you want to change it up, you could use my instead, which is made from salsa verde (jarred is fine). Then, youll sauté red onion, bell pepper, broccoli and spinach. Broccoli is an uncommon ingredient in enchiladas, but I love it here. If youre hesitant and want a more neutral flavor, substitute cauliflower instead. Cumin and a small amount of cinnamon (yes, cinnamon!) ramp up the flavor. Once the vegetables are done cooking, well transfer them to a bowl and add drained black beans, plus a small amount of cheese and a splash of enchilada sauce for flavoring. Then well assemble the enchiladas, drizzle the remaining sauce, sprinkle with cheese, and bake until golden. If you want extra cheesy enchiladas, you could double the cheese (use a full 8 ounces). This recipe calls for flour tortillas. I like to use whole wheat for some extra flavor and fiber. Corn tortillas are more traditional, but my mom always used flour tortillas in her enchiladas when we were growing up, so I used flour. If youd like to use corn tortillas, you certainly can. Youll need more than 8 of them, likely 12. Gently warm them in the microwave or one at a time on the stovetop before using (otherwise, they might break when rolling). Watch How to Make Vegetarian Enchiladas how to make vegetarian enchiladas How to Freeze These Enchiladas You can make these enchiladas as directed and freeze them instead of baking them. I also tried baking and then freezing them, but it was more work with no payoff.

Ive successfully used Pyrex baking dishes straight from the freezer to the oven. Beware theres always a slight risk that the dish could break. Once frozen, they will keep for up to six months in the freezer. Frozen foods technically never go bad when the freezing environment is perfectly consistent, though they generally taste better when consumed sooner. To bake the frozen enchiladas, first ensure that the exterior of the baking dish is dry by wiping it with a towel—this helps avoid shocking the glass. Bake as directed in the recipe below, then cover the dish snugly with parchment paper or aluminum foil and bake until it is fully cooked through and bubbling, probably about 45 minutes total or longer (covering the dish prevents it from becoming too browned). Enjoy! Serving Suggestions These enchiladas are a well-rounded main dish offering vegetables, greens, whole grains and protein. If youre hosting friends, perhaps start with or with chips.

Im always so eager to hear from you. veggie black bean enchiladas Amazing vegetarian enchiladas stuffed with black beans, broccoli, bell pepper and spinach, topped with homemade red sauce. My favorite enchilada recipe! Recipe yields 8 enchiladas, enough for about 4 servings. Ingredients 2 cups homemade enchilada sauce 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 cup chopped red onion (about 1 small red onion) 1 red bell pepper, chopped 1 bunch of broccoli or 1 small head of cauliflower (about 1 pound), florets removed and sliced into small, bite-sized pieces 1 teaspoon ground cumin ¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon 5 to 6 ounces baby spinach (about 5 cups, packed) 1 can (15 ounces) black beans, drained and rinsed, or 1 ½ cups cooked black beans 1 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese, divided ½ teaspoon fine salt, to taste Freshly ground black pepper, to taste 8 whole wheat tortillas (about 8 inches in diameter) Handful of chopped cilantro, for garnishing  Preheat oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit with one rack in the middle of the oven and one in the upper third. Lightly grease a 9 by 13-inch pan with olive oil or cooking spray. In a large skillet over medium heat, warm the olive oil until simmering. Add the onions and a pinch of salt. Cook, stirring often, until the onions are tender and translucent, about 5 to 7 minutes. Add the broccoli and bell pepper, stir, and reduce heat to medium-low. Cover the skillet and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 8 to 9 minutes, or until the broccoli is brighter green and just starting to turn golden on the edges. Add the cumin and cinnamon to the skillet and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the spinach, a few handfuls at a time, stirring until it has reduced in size. Repeat with the remaining spinach and cook until all of the spinach has wilted. Transfer the contents of the pan to a medium mixing bowl. Add the drained beans, ¼ cup cheese and a drizzle of enchilada sauce (about 2 tablespoons). Season with ½ teaspoon salt and some freshly ground black pepper, to taste. Assemble the enchiladas: Pour ¼ cup enchilada sauce into your prepared pan and tilt it from side to side until the bottom of the pan is evenly coated. To assemble your first enchilada, spread ½ cup filling mixture down the middle of a tortilla, then snugly wrap the left side over and then the right, to make a wrap. Place it seam-side down against the edge of your pan. Repeat with remaining tortillas and filling. Drizzle the remaining enchilada sauce evenly over the enchiladas, leaving the tips of the enchiladas bare. Sprinkle the remaining shredded cheese evenly over the enchiladas. Bake, uncovered, on the middle rack for 20 minutes. If the cheese on top isnt golden enough for your liking, carefully transfer the enchiladas to the upper rack of the oven and bake for an additional 3 to 6 minutes, until sufficiently golden and bubbly. Remove from oven and let the enchiladas rest for 10 minutes (theyre super hot!). Before serving, sprinkle chopped cilantro down the center of the enchiladas. Serve immediately. Leftovers will keep well for up to 4 days in the refrigerator, covered.  Recipe adapted from my spinach artichoke enchiladas. Make it vegan: You could just skip the cheese altogether and still end up with awesome enchiladas. For some extra creaminess, you might top them with sliced avocado or a drizzle of vegan sour cream. Make it gluten free: Substitute certified gluten-free flour tortillas, or use corn tortillas (theyre smaller than my 8-inch tortillas, so you might need more than 8 tortillas). If you use corn tortillas, gently warm them together in the microwave or individually on the stove before you try to roll them up, or they might break.",

Onion– I use a yellow onion, but red or white will work too. Red bell pepper– Feel free to use yellow or orange bell pepper! Garlic– Fresh is best! Quinoa– I love adding quinoa for a protein boost and it makes the dish super filling. Always rinse your quinoa before using. Vegetable broth– Cooking the quinoa in vegetable broth adds more flavor! Fire roasted tomatoes– Use fire roasted tomatoes for ultimate flavor. They arent spicy. Green chiles– Make sure you buy canned MILD green chiles. Spices– You will need chili powder, cumin, smoked paprika, and oregano. If you want a spicy kick, add a pinch of cayenne pepper. Salt and Pepper– Always! Black beans– I use canned black beans. Rinse and drain before using. You can also use pinto beans. Corn– You can use frozen corn or cut fresh corn off of the cob. Cilantro– My favorite! If you think it tastes like soap, you can leave it out:) Cheese– You can use shredded cheddar cheese or a Mexican blend. Monterey Jack or Pepper Jack would also be good. Use your favorite.

        "text": "The Best No-Bean Vegan Chili Carrie Walder . Please see my disclosure policy. This hearty no-bean vegan chili recipe is packed with vegetables, spices, and tempeh. Its gluten-free and high in protein and fibre. Healthy, easy to make, and SO comforting! overhead photo of three white bowl with vegan chili topped with yogurt and limes on black plate IMPORTANT EDIT: This recipe does not contain the typical beans used in most chili recipes (e.g. kidney beans or black beans) which some people may find difficult to digest. It IS made with crumbled tempeh, which is a fermented soybean product. Tempeh is low FODMAP and typically much easier to digest than beans, but it is not appropriate if you have a soybean allergy. If youre allergic to soy and eat meat, you can swap the tempeh with ground beef or turkey. Looking for a warm, hearty, and nourishing recipe to enjoy? Youve come to the right place! This no-bean vegan chili is the ultimate cold weather meal. Traditionally, chili is made with ground beef. This recipe is made with crumbled tempeh, which is just as high in protein but suitable for those who follow a vegan or vegetarian diet. In addition to tempeh, this recipe packs in 6 different kinds of vegetables, making it rich in fibre, vitamins, and minerals. Chili is also traditionally made with beans, but I wanted to share a no-bean version for those of you who dont tolerate or digest beans well. I fall into this category, so I guess I wanted a chili recipe that I too could enjoy hah! While this recipe has a longer cooking time (most of it is hands-off though!), its really easy to make. Chili also happens to make great leftovers, so this recipe is perfect for batch cooking or meal prep. I hope you love it as much as I do! closeup overhead shot of white bowl with vegan chili topped with yogurt and limes on black plate Why No Beans? This chili is made without beans NOT because beans arent good for you. Theyre super healthy and if you enjoy and digest them well, then please feel free to include them! That said, for some people (myself included) beans are difficult to digest. Why? Beans are high in a type of carbohydrate (fibre) called oligosaccharides. Humans have trouble digesting oligosaccharides because we dont have the enzymes to break it down. What does this mean? Because we dont digest them, those fibres will travel to our large intestine, where they are broken down by bacterial fermentation. A result of that fermentation? The production of gas. For some people – primarily those with IBS or other digestive concerns – this gas production can be very uncomfortable or even painful. Again – if you tolerate or enjoy beans, feel free to include them in this recipe. I never want to discourage anyone from eating them. Rather, I wanted to share an option for people who dont tolerate beans well, as most chili recipes contain large amounts of them. 45 degree angle photo of white bowl with vegan chili topped with yogurt and limes on black plate Vegan Chili Recipe Ingredients This no-bean vegan chili recipe is packed with veggies, spices, and protein. Heres what you need to make it: tempeh carrots celery bell peppers mushrooms canned tomatoes (crushed or diced) canned corn (or fresh) tomato paste chili powder smoked paprika cumin oregano veggie broth nutritional yeast garlic + optional onion olive oil overhead shot of several white bowls filled with recipe ingredients on grey backdrop Recipe Variations This recipe is packed with different kinds of veggies, but feel free to swap out a couple as desired. Dont feel like celery or carrots? Thats ok! Just increase the servings of the other vegetables. Dont want to use tempeh? You could try this with crumbled tofu, a vegan meat crumble, or ground meat if you arent vegan/vegetarian. I didnt include onion + beans because I cant digest them. If you tolerate these ingredients – feel free to add them in! overhead shot of grey bowl filled with crumbled tempeh How To Make Vegan Chili Without Beans Making this vegan chili is super easy! Dont be put off by the cooking time – most of it is just letting all the ingredients simmer in a pot 🙂 You want to start this recipe by prepping all your ingredients – crumbling the tempeh with your hands (so that it looks like the picture above), chopping all the vegetables into small pieces, and getting all your spices ready to go. Then, heat up a LARGE pot on the stove and add the olive oil, garlic, spices, and crumbled tempeh to the pot and cook for about 5 mins. NOTE: This recipe is large in volume and makes about 6 servings. I used a pot that holds 12 cups (3L) of ingredients. If you dont have a big enough pot, I would recommend cutting the recipe in half! Then, add in all the chopped veggies, along with the canned tomatoes, canned corn, veggie broth, and tomato paste. Stir everything together well, adding salt + pepper to taste. Bring the liquids to a boil before lowering the heat to a simmer. Allow the chili to simmer (uncovered) for 60 minutes. Remove from heat, stir in nutritional yeast, and allow the chili to rest for 5-10 mins before serving. overhead shot of three white bowls filled with vegan chili on wood cutting board What To Serve With Chili There are so many different things you can serve with this chili recipe! Some ideas: a starch, like quinoa, farro, rice, toasted bread, cornbread, or tortilla chips shredded cheddar cheese or vegan alternative a scoop of greek yogurt or vegan alternative toppings, like avocado chunks, limes (to squeeze in), cilantro or parsley  & Reheating  Chili should be refrigerated or frozen within 2 hours of cooking. Cooked chili will stay fresh for 3-4 days in the fridge, if stored in an airtight container. If youd like to freeze a batch of this chili, it will keep for up to 6 months in the freezer when properly stored. Again, a freezer-safe airtight container or heavy-duty bag will work best. Cooked chili that has been frozen and then thawed in the fridge will last for an additional 3-4 days in the refrigerator. Tempeh  Facts One of my favourite sources of plant-based protein, this fermented soy product has a denser and meatier taste to tofu. A 100 gram serving packs 19 grams of complete protein, 9 grams of carbohydrates and 11 grams of fat (mostly unsaturated). Tempeh is also a great source of micronutrients like iron, calcium, vitamin B6, phosphorus, and magnesium, too. 45 degree angle photo of 3 white bowls of vegan chili on wood cutting board More Healthy, Comforting Recipes Vegetarian Lasagna Soup Vegan Vegetable Stew Creamy Vegan Miso Mushroom Soup Roasted Butternut Squash & Pear Soup (Vegan) Coconut Curry Tofu With Vegetables (Vegan) Did you give this No-Bean Vegan Chili Recipe a try?

FEATURED COMMENT: Made this last night- so good! Served with pearl couscous. Love how your recipes are easy, quick, healthy and dont require obscure ingredients. So glad I found your site and Im cooking from it all the time now. - Meryl My last recipe for Vegan Sheet Pan Fajitas was a total hit! Sheet pan meals are so quick and easy to make, that I knew I had to share another recipe immediately! This vegan Greek sheet pan dinner is just as quick and easy. The instructions are simple, mix up the marinade made of olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, oregano, basil, Dijon mustard, and salt and pepper, likely ingredients you already have stocked in your kitchen. (Check the recipe notes for the oil-free version). Now just toss zucchini, cherry tomatoes, bell pepper, red onion, and tofu in the marinade and bake. The trick for the tofu is to tear it into chunks (do not cut it into cubes)! When you tear tofu into chunks it has a random shape and rougher surface. The rough surface grips onto the marinade so it gets super flavorful and the random shapes make it look and taste more like chicken than tofu (trust me on this)! Once its done roasting sprinkle olives and vegan feta over top. I garnished mine with some fresh oregano from my garden for the photos, or you could use parsley if desired. For the feta you can use a store-bought vegan feta or you can try my homemade vegan feta recipe. Vegan Greek Sheet Pan dinner is a healthy weeknight dinner that is quick and easy to make!

        "text": "Crispy Baked Sesame Tofu Claire CaryMay 14, 2024 For an easy weeknight dinner, look no further than this crispy baked sesame tofu! Its so easy to make, requires only 10 minutes of prep time and is completely vegan and gluten free. crispy baked sesame tofu in a bowl with broccoli and chopsticks Its no secret around here that Im a big, ok huge, fan of sesame anything. Sesame noodles, chickpeas, cauliflower, sesame chickpea meatballs, now sesame tofu?! Sesame salmon is next on my list but Im always open to suggestions! Easy dinners are my favorite kind of dinners. Easy dinners that are so flavorful are the absolute best. This baked tofu recipe is exactly that and I cannot wait for you to try it! I love to serve it up with some rice and broccoli to make a sort of buddha bowl, but you can also serve it in a stir fry or with my vegan fried rice. Tofu does not contain sesame as it is just made with soy beans, but this recipe contains sesame oil for a delicious sesame flavor. If you love this recipe, try my crispy garlic tofu, gochujang korean tofu or tofu burrito bowl next! Why youll love this recipe Vegan & gluten free Packed with flavor Crispy Easy to make ingredients in bowls with labels Tips for crispy tofu Ill admit, I totally understand why some people are so turned off by tofu. It doesnt look all that great straight out of the package, and without any sauce, it doesnt have much of a flavor. However, (and a big however!), if you know how to cook tofu properly, then you can make it taste seriously delicious. Crispy, flavorful, easy to make, high in protein… basically everything you could want. The key to baking tofu is to bake it plain and with some sort of flour or starch. Baking it without any sauce ensures the tofu on its own is able to crisp up and without burning the sauce. The flour/starch works to absorb any excess moisture to give us a super crispy exterior and soft interior. Well then coat it in the sauce after it bakes so it stays crispy! two photos showing how to make the recipe How to make sesame tofu Cut tofu. Cut a slit in the side of the tofu container and drain out all of the excess liquid. Remove the tofu from the package and wrap it in a towel just to get off as much liquid as possible without having to press the tofu. Once it seems dry, cut the tofu into 1 inch cubes. WANT TO SAVE THIS RECIPE? Enter your email below & well send it straight to your inbox. Plus youll get great new recipes from us every week! Prep tofu. Once the tofu is cubed, add it to a large bowl and toss with the soy sauce. Next, toss in the cornstarch then the breadcrumbs. I like to just shake the bowl so the tofu doesnt break (sometimes it breaks if you use a spoon) and toss until every piece is well coated. Bake. Add to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, and try to ensure none of the tofu pieces touch each other. I know that seems annoying, but the space between really helps it get crispy. Make sauce. Add the tofu to the oven and bake for about 30 minutes or until golden brown. While the tofu is baking, well prepare the sauce on the stove. Serve. Once the sauce and tofu are done, toss both together until well coated and enjoy! I like to serve it with brown or white rice and some steamed broccoli. angled view of the tofu in a bowl with chopsticks getting a piece Do you need to press tofu? Yes and no. You can absolutely get away with not pressing the tofu for this recipe. I dont list it in the instructions because this recipe turns out really well without any pressing. Plus, it saves a lot of time! Tofu is basically a sponge that sits in water and absorbs all of it. Pressing out the excess water does help make it more crispy and ensures it cooks evenly through the center. If youre trying to get flavors into the tofu, you do want to press it. In the case of this sesame tofu, were trying to get a crispy outside so the sauce will stick on the outside, so pressing isnt necessary. Moral of the story, nothing bad will happen if you dont press tofu, but if you want the crispiest and most flavorful tofu around, press away! How to store and reheat Once prepared, this sesame tofu will keep in the fridge for 3 days. It is best served fresh, but you can pop everything back in the oven at 200 for 10 minutes to crisp it back up. The microwave also works, but tends to make things a bit soft/soggy, but the flavor will still be delicious. sesame tofu in a bowl with broccoli and rice Youll also love..

Its so easy to make, requires only 10 minutes of prep time and is completely vegan and gluten free. / /  10 mins  30 mins  40 mins 4  Preheat the oven to 400 Fahrenheit. Drain the excess liquid from the tofu and dry it off with a towel*. Cut into 1 inch cubes and add to a large bowl. Toss with the soy sauce. Toss with the cornstarch, then the breadcrumbs until all pieces are evenly coated. Add to the baking tray lined with parchment paper and bake for 30-35 minutes or until golden brown. During the final 10 minutes, prep the sauce. Mince the garlic and saute with 1 tbsp oil in a small saute pan for 2-3 minutes or until lightly browned. Add in the soy sauce, honey or maple syrup, rice vinegar, 2 tbsp of water and sesame oil. Whisk together the cornstarch and other 2 tbsp of water in a bowl and add to the pan. Heat over low heat for 3-5 minutes or until the sauce bubbles and thickens. When the tofu is done, toss with the sauce. Garnish with sesame seeds if desired and serve over rice with steamed broccoli or enjoy as is!  If you have a tofu press or extra time on your hands, definitely press the tofu, but it is not necessary for this recipe. It will make it crispier, but you can easily skip it! I always use low sodium soy sauce, if you use regular soy sauce you may want to add a bit of water to the sauce so the saltiness isnt overpowering.

        "text": "Honey Garlic Tofu (Vegan) Liz MadsenJun 17, 2022 This delicious Honey Garlic Tofu is a super easy and flavorful dish. Serve it with rice and your favorite vegetable for a fantastic and satisfying meal. . See our for details. Hey Internet, I love a good tofu dish. In fact, I have a ton of because I just cant get enough. Honey Garlic Tofu is such a great flavor combination. Its sweet, its salty, its garlicky, and you can make it spicy easily too. The tofu is cooked until its crispy and then added to this addictive sauce… so good! And yes, its vegan--no bees were involved. :) This dish is similar to my , and utilizes my favorite way to make . If you like this dish, I know youll also like my (tofu), (also tofu), , and . I love serving this vegan honey garlic tofu over jasmine rice with baby broccoli, though any veggie (even stir fried veggies) would be perfect. Why This Recipe Works When you cook down a sauce with any type of sugar in it, it gets super sticky, and thats what happens to the honey (we used agave) in this recipe. Technically any sugar will work. Theres a massive amount of garlic in my version of this recipe, but of course youre welcome to dial it back if youre not a garlic freak like my husband and I are. Hopefully we dont perpetually smell like garlic to others… BTW a quick trick for getting the garlic smell out of your hands is to make a slurry from water and , rub it on your hands, and wash it off! The tofu in this recipe is cooked separately until the sauce is ready, so it retains all of its chewy and crispy texture. And then once its coated in the sauce, it gets served immediately and I promise its completely delicious. Ingredients on a tabletop Ingredients and  For the tofu: For the sauce: Step by Step  for Honey Garlic Tofu Frequently Asked Questions Whats the best type of tofu to use for this recipe? The absolute best tofu for this recipe is super firm tofu. Look for the tofu that comes vacuum sealed in plastic as opposed to the tofu that comes in a plastic tub filled with water. If you can only find firm or extra firm tofu that comes in water, youll want to drain the excess water and press the tofu block using a or two plates or cutting boards, paper towels, and a heavy weight (like books or a cast iron pan) for 20-30 minutes. Otherwise it may turn out soggy. Will this recipe work with another plant based protein? Yes, you can use almost any other plant based protein in this recipe, with the note that they may need to be prepared differently. For example, if using store-bought or pre-made seitan chunks, you can just reheat them in a skillet and brown them a little, then they will be perfect to add into the sauce at the end of cooking just like I do the tofu. The same goes for any store-bought chicken or beef alternative (like Gardein), but just prepare it according to package instructions and then add it to the vegan honey garlic sauce. If youd like to use soy curls, I recommend rehydrating them in flavorful broth, squeezing the excess marinade off, and then dry frying in a skillet, adding a touch of oil only when they start to brown. Im actually writing a book on soy curls, but in the meantime, learn more about how I use them in . How do I time the cooking of the rest of the meal? It can be tricky to manage cooking multiple things at once, especially when they cook at different temperatures and/or for different lengths of time. I recommend doing it this way: After you get the tofu in the air fryer or oven, start the rice (this is provided youre using white rice which cooks faster. If using brown rice, you may want to start it 10-15 minutes before starting the tofu.). Dont start the baby broccoli until right before you start to saute the garlic for the sauce (step 6). I steamed my baby broccoli, but I think it would take about the same time on a skillet. Alternatively, you could roast your vegetables starting when you start the tofu. Keep in mind that some vegetables (like carrots and potatoes) take a lot longer to cook, so if you cut them small (around ½ thick or less) theyll cook faster. What to Serve with this Tofu? One of my favorite ways to prepare a meal is to think about components. Especially when were talking about tofu. Tofu, in my opinion, is best served with a starch and a vegetable (or multiple vegetables!). My favorite starch to serve with tofu is rice, and I usually like to use jasmine rice when I make Asian-inspired dishes, or dishes like this one that arent really Asian, but do use flavors and ingredients commonly found in Asian dishes, like soy sauce and toasted sesame oil. Other good starches to serve with tofu include: Any vegetable would go well with this delicious honey garlic tofu, but I think the following vegetables would pair exceptionally well with this dish: How Long Does This Recipe Keep? The cooked and coated tofu will last about 3 days in an airtight container. I think its best the first day, and still great the second day. The third day the leftovers still tasted great but the texture was not quite as good. Still a good meal, so thats why I say 3 days. I recommend reheating the tofu in a pan to try and get some texture back. But if youre reheating it at work and only have a microwave, its still pretty good.

        "text": "Vegetable Pasta - One Pot! By:Nagi Published:24 Sep 18Updated:14 Aug 23 A quick Vegetable Pasta thats made with less pasta and more veggies that tastes so amazing, no one realises its a healthy pasta recipe!!! Its a vegetarian pasta loaded with a whole head of broccoli, corn, zucchinis, capsicum/peppers and onion, and smothered in a garlic herb tomato sauce. All made in one pot – from scratch, in 20 minutes. *Fist pump!* Overhead close up of One Pot Vegetable Pasta (healthy pasta recipe) in a white pot, fresh off the stove ready to be served Vegetable Pasta Theres a time for making – roasting veggies until beautifully caramelised, making a pasta sauce, cooking the pasta, then bringing it all together at the end. Itll take close to an hour, and its totally fabulous. This one pot vegetarian pasta is for all those other times. A complete meal that covers all bases: One Pot Vegetable Pasta (healthy pasta recipe) in a white pot, fresh off the stove ready to be served. Choose your own vegetables and pasta This is a terrific versatile vegetarian pasta that you can make your own using your vegetables of choice. Ive used a whole head of broccoli, the icy remains of frozen corn, 2 zucchinis nearing the end of their life and a capsicum/bell pepper. All vegetables I happened to have (albeit I then had to go out and buy them again to make the video 😂) You can also choose your own pasta. This recipe will work with any short pasta – macaroni, spirals, penne, ziti (which is what Ive used). Jeez, Im being flexible today, arent I! I figure after all the rules I set out in Fridays I was due for a nice and easy use what you want recipe today. 😂 Though having said that, while this vegetable pasta is adaptable to whatever vegetables and short pasta you want, the liquid quantities and cook times are not as flexible so please do follow the recipe. Ingredients in One Pot Vegetable Pasta (healthy pasta recipe) A 20 Minute Quick Healthy Dinner This recipe has a nice flow to it. I start off by chopping the garlic and onion, then get that on the stove to cook slowly on a low heat so it becomes sweet and becomes an amazing flavour base for this quick healthy dinner. In between leisurely stirring the onion every now and then, I chop the other vegetables, pop open cans and measure out the herbs and spices so its all ready to go into the pot by the time the onion is done. Once the pasta is in, it takes a mere 10 minutes to finish cooking. Much longer than this and youll end up with soggy pasta, so basically, this has to be a quick 20 minutes recipe otherwise your pasta is overcooked! 😂 How to make One Pot Vegetable Pasta (healthy pasta recipe) Overhead photo of healthy pasta / one pot vegetable pasta in a rustic bowl, ready to be eaten. I know Im talking up how this is a healthy Vegetable Pasta recipe but when you watch the video, youre going to see me toss in a nice handful of cheese thats stirred through the pasta, then a bit more to melt on top. Theres no denying cheese makes this even tastier, but for a healthier option, opt for some parmesan instead. Excluding the cheese, this pasta is a mere 378 calories per serving – and its a generous serving size, this recipe makes a big pot full! Either way, youre going to be yscoffing this down. Added bonus: its great Couch Food.

A quick healthy dinner with more veg and less pasta, all made in one pot! For a lower cal option, skip the cheese and serve with parmesan sprinkled on top. Workflow: Get the onion cooking while you prep the other ingredients. Cook ModePrevent screen from sleeping  Heat oil in a large pot over medium. Add garlic and onion - cook slowly for 3 to 4 minutes until onion is translucent and sweet. Turn heat up to medium high, add zucchini and capsicum. Cook 1 1/2 minutes. Add remaining ingredients EXCEPT pasta and broccoli. Stir until tomato paste dissolves. When liquid starts bubbling, lower heat to medium, add pasta and stir. Top with broccoli, push in. Place lid on and cook for 5 minutes. Remove lid. Cook for another 3 to 4 minutes, stirring frequently, until pasta is almost cooked through and most of the liquid has been absorbed by the pasta. Stir through half the cheese (if using). Adjust salt and pepper to taste. Top with remaining cheese, put lid on. Leave for 1 minute until cheese is melted and pasta is perfectly cooked. Garnish with parsley and serve immediately. Dont leave leftovers in the pot, residual heat will overcook the pasta so transfer into a serving dish. Recipe : * These vegetables can be switched with vegetables of choice - use 7 to 8 cups in total, chopped or sliced. Cook cauliflower and broccolini in the same way the broccoli is cooked in this recipe ie placed on top of the pasta so it steams first before stirring through. 1. Pasta - any short pasta can be used: penne, ziti, macaroni, spirals. Pasta cook times may need adjustment. If undercooked to your taste and liquid has reduced down, just add a touch of water. Most important is to ensure you dont overcook the pasta! Mushy pasta is not pleasant! 2.  per serving, assuming 5 servings excluding the cheese which is optional. Cheese adds 120 calories per serve. If cheese is omitted, serve with parmesan instead.  Facts Vegetable Pasta - One Pot!

This cozy bean soup is another one of our earliest Crowded Kitchen blog posts, but it needed a major facelift! Weve revamped the recipe a bit to make it quicker and easier, and we also took a few new photos for your viewing pleasure. Were so happy we revisited this recipe. Its packed with plant-based protein from three different varieties of beans: cannellini, garbanzo and kidney beans. With plenty of vegetables and a flavorful broth, its a well balanced meal.

They do take a bit more prep time, so weve also included instructions if youd prefer to use canned. overhead view of vegan bean vegetable soup in white pot.

It takes about an hour and a half to prep dried beans for this soup, but most of the time is completely hands off. Rinse the dried beans well and check for any debris (rocks, dirt, etc.). Add to a large pot and cover with water. There should be about 3 inches of water above the beans. Add a large pinch of salt. Bring the beans to a boil for 5 minutes.

Drain the beans well before adding to the soup. side view of vegan vegetable bean soup in white bowl on white linen. Ingredients Dried beans: we used cannellini, kidney and garbanzo beans. You can also use navy or pinto beans. We love the different textures of each bean, but you can also just use one variety if preferred. Dont have any dried beans? Substitute with 2 15oz. cans of beans. Drain and rinse well before adding to the soup. If using canned beans, this soup will only need to simmer for 20-25 minutes before serving. Onion & garlic Carrots Celery Sweet potato: you can also use regular potatoes (I prefer Yukon gold), squash (butternut works well), parsnips, turnips or more carrot. Vegetable broth Fire roasted tomatoes Red wine vinegar Seasonings: bay leaves, Italian seasoning blend, salt and red pepper flakes Baby kale or spinach and fresh parsley: for freshness and a dose of leafy greens! close up view of bean vegetable soup.

My family honestly likes these energy bites even better now, because theyre not so … well … sweet. And, of course, less sugar is always a win! But dont worry … for those of you whove been making those original Quick and Healthy Snack Bites for years … you can still make em the same way you always did. Closeup of one healthy Energy Ball laying between bowls of chocolate chips and wheat germ. But trust me. Try cutting back the honey a bit, and I bet you wont even notice! Why We All Need Energy Balls in Our Lives (The Backstory) I first started this website back in 2013, with my very best friend and business partner, Gretchen. We knew that this one, simple energy ball recipe was the perfect, yummy little hero to help us kick off our brand-new site. Heres how it happened (cue the time warp) … Once upon a time, in a land not-so-far-away, there were two beautiful princesses (sorry, got carried away there) … we were chatting about our kids hectic schedules, and we came to a realization: Hands-down, the weak link in our families otherwise nutritious lives was the grab-and-go snack! Wed always tried to be really diligent about providing super-healthy meals, but somehow the wheels totally fell off at snack time. Oh sure, we had the best intentions. But, as the kids came home from school and the whirlwind of homework and afternoon activities began, we often found ourselves reaching for those convenient (and maybe not-so-healthy) snacks. And, talking with friends, we realized that most other families were facing the exact same challenges. Healthy snacks were somehow just hard to achieve in the midst of busy family schedules. We knew there had to be a better way! We scoured cookbooks and the Internet looking for fun and healthy ideas. We tested, tasted, re-tested, re-tasted … you get the idea. And finally we found a winner! (aaaaahhhhhhh – picture a choir of angels singing here) Hand holding one ball with bowl full and individual energy balls in background. Actually, we found lots of winners (some were even hiding in our own recipe collections!), and we couldt wait to tell you all about them as we launched this site! This Peanut Butter Energy Ball recipe, however, quickly found its way into our hearts (and our tummies, again … and again …)! We just knew that this HAD to be our first recipe post. It truly does feature every single thing we stand for here at THK – its so tasty, so nutritious, so quick, and so easy! We adapted our recipe from Maggie at Smashed Peas and Carrots, and you can find her original recipe here. While we absolutely loved her version, we wondered if we could amp up the nutrition without losing any of the flavor … cause thats just how we roll. We concocted about 8 or 10 different variations (yeah, we were eating A LOT of these, long before we ever shared them with all of you!) until we settled on the perfect balance. In our version, we: √ Swapped in wheat germ for some of the flax, which allowed us to keep a decent amount of the beneficial omega-3 fatty acids, while reducing the calories and total fat a bit, and increasing the Vitamin E and folic acid a smidge. √ We also reduced the chocolate chips, which meant less sugar. √ And we used crunchy peanut butter for, well, some added crunch. Ingredients for making these bites, in individual bowls with mixing bowl and measuring spoons. Our families fell in love with them. We stocked our freezers with healthy snack bags full of grab-and-go energy balls. They really even developed somewhat of a legendary, cult-following amongst our early readers. Thank you, tiny Peanut Butter Energy Balls. You truly were the perfect way to kick off our site! And with this little refresh … brand-new pics, a few tried-and-true tips and tricks … the beloved snack bites are ready to keep right on snackin with new readers (and of course, with all our original, reader-friends, too)! Heres all youve gotta do to give them a try … How to Make Your Peanut Butter Energy Balls Step #1 Begin by adding your ingredients (except, hold off on the chocolate chips – for now) into a medium bowl. Mix it all together until its really well combined. (And, yeah … this is probably a good time for a little taste test. Mmmmmmmm …) Mixing bowl filled with peanut butter and other ingredients, just beginning to be mixed together. Mixing bowl where the grains, honey and coconut have been mixed with the peanut butter. Step #2 Next stop … the chocolate chips! Yeah, this is where it gets REALLY good. I mean … chocolate chips and peanut butter??? Yes, please! Mix em right on in there, so youll get little bits of chocolate in every bite. (And nows another great taste test opportunity. Just sayin 😉 ) Mixing bowl full of peanut butter mixture with chocolate chips poured on top and ready to be mixed in. Step #3 See how easy this is? Youre practically done already. (The hardest part is the taste testing, right?!?!) Now all thats left to do is shape your yummy, healthy snack mixture into one-inch balls. (Unless youve already eaten it all straight from the bowl. Which I would totally understand.) Pro Tip: You cant just lightly roll this between your hands like cookie dough. You actually have to press it together firmly to get it to stick. Closeup of two hands shaping a ball, with mixing bowl in background. Although its ok if your energy bites sit out at room temperature for a while, we recommend storing them in the fridge (particularly if youre using natural peanut butter that should be refrigerated), or stashing them in the freezer. Which brings me to: Make-Ahead Tips • Your Peanut Butter Energy Balls will keep beautifully in the fridge for several days. • But, I actually like to store mine in the freezer, where theyll easily last for 3 months or more (although Im not sure mine have ever made it quite that long before being chowed). • To make healthy snacking as easy as possible on busy days, it helps to pre-package two or three energy balls per zippered snack baggie. Then, gather up all those individual baggies and store them together in one, big, gallon-sized freezer bag. When the munchies strike, a healthy snack is as easy as opening the freezer. See ya later, store-bought junk snacks! Big Batch Tips So, if Ive talked you into freezing these, then the next obvious step is to make a BIG batch while youre at it. Stock the freezer … meal prep snack prep for the win! In fact, I almost always make a quadruple batch, any time Im making energy balls. Ive found a couple tricks to help: Trick #1 If youre making a giant batch of Peanut Butter Energy Balls, it helps to mix all the dry ingredients together first (the oats, coconut, flax and wheat germ). Then add the wet ingredients … and then finally the chocolate chips. Although its no problem to thoroughly incorporate the dry and wet ingredients together in a normal, 1x recipe situation … when youve got a ginormous mixing bowl goin on, its much easier to get the dry ingredients mixed together before adding the sticky peanut butter and honey. Oblong bowl piled with energy balls, with other bites laying in background nearby. Trick #2 The one downside to making such huge batches is that it takes a little while to shape sooooo many energy balls. (Even though, later, youll be so glad you did!) It seemed like, whenever I did this, I kept running out of time before I had to scurry off to the next meeting or soccer pick-up. Turns out, this is actually no problem! I quickly figured out that I could simply throw some plastic wrap over whatever energy ball mixture was left, un-balled in my mixing bowl. I shove the bowl in the fridge, and finish shaping the balls a day or two later, whenever I have a couple more free moments. Working in big batches saves so much time, and this energy ball recipe is super flexible to accommodate however much time you happen to have! FAQs At-a-Glance Can I Make Energy Balls with Other Nut Butters, Besides Peanut Butter? Sure! We have specific Energy Ball recipes for almond butter, and even walnut and pecan butter, too. (See the list down below for lots of ideas!) Can I Use Old-Fashioned Oats in Energy Balls, Instead of Quick Oats? We really prefer quick oats in this particular Peanut Butter Energy Balls recipe. But, you technically can use old-fashioned oats if you prefer. Its important to note, though, that the texture of your finished energy bites will be much chewier because of the thicker, coarser nature of the old-fashioned oats. Can Energy Balls Be Frozen? Absolutely! In fact, its a great idea to make a triple- or quadruple-batch, and store them in the freezer. Theyll last for at least 3 months, all ready for healthy snacks any time you need em. I recommend portioning the balls out into individual, snack-sized zipper bags, and then storing all the little baggies together in one big, gallon-sized freezer bag. Do I Have to Make All the Energy Balls Right Away? What If I Run Out of Time? No problem here! Especially when I make a huge quadruple-batch, I often dont finish making all the little energy bites right away. Just mix the ingredients all together and cover your mixing bowl with plastic wrap, then stash it in the fridge until you have time to finish. You can feel good about handing these over to your kids (if you dont eat them all yourself!) for a quick snack as you dash out the door. With all the whole grains, fiber and protein packed into these little gems, you can be sure this snack will stick to their ribs and give them the power they need! Our families are even content to have these tasty nuggets of joy for dessert! 5 completed balls laying next to the mixing bowl filled with peanut butter and other mixed ingredients.

Oval serving bowl filled with finished Energy Balls.

This Recipe Is: • Ready in 30 Minutes or Less • Freezable • Make Ahead • Vegetarian •  Honey: This recipe was originally published calling for 1/3 cup honey. But, through all my years making these, I started to decrease the honey by even as much as about 1/3 – and nobody seems to notice. Energy Balls made with less honey will not be quite as wet and sticky, but I still have no trouble forming them. Shaping the Energy Balls: Be sure that you are pressing these balls together FIRMLY (not lightly rolling the balls like cookie dough). If youre still having trouble, it could be that youre using a type of natural peanut butter thats stiffer/firmer than what we usually use (some brands are very thick) or that your coconut is quite dried out (I normally use Bakers brand, which Ive noticed is moister than some others). Also, youll have a lot more difficulty forming balls if you try to substitute regular-sized chocolate chips, instead of the minis we specify. Regardless, to correct for this issue, I recommend slightly decreasing some of the dry ingredients (such as the oats, flax, or wheat germ).  and freezable make-ahead tips: If your peanut butter is one of the natural brands that needs to be refrigerated, then so do your Snack Bites. Actually, regardless of the peanut butter you use, these will keep much better in the refrigerator. They can even be frozen in air-tight bags for up to 3 months. When frozen, these energy balls will be thawed in about 20 minutes.

Its a big serving for big appetites, perfect for refueling after a big workout or keeping you full for hours. If your appetite isnt quite as big as mine, you can definitely get by with dividing these recipes into two. Here are the jars I recommend: Jars for Overnight Oats: Weck 742 Half Liter (fits full batch, pictured): I love these jars because there are no disposable parts, and they are just so darn cute, but they are priiiiicceeyyy. If you take care of them though, theyll last a lifetime (or even more). Ball Wide Mouth Pint (fits full batch): These are classic, and for good reason. They are affordable, readily available, and great quality. The wide mouth makes it easy to scoop in (and get out!) the oats. They come with the metal two-piece lids, but I recommend getting the Ball plastic caps to go with them. You cant preserve with those caps, but they are great for storage use. Weck 762 Jelly Jar 1/5 Liter (fits half batch): How cute are these guys? They are a touch less than half of the full batch, so you might have a scoop or two leftover, but if you really pack the oats in, you should be just fine! Kerr Wide Mouth Half Pint (fits half batch): These can sometimes be hard to track down in stores, but they are a great jar to have around the house. We use these mason jars for everything from overnight oats, to storing thumbtacks, to actual jelly canning. I like them because they have clear sides. In the summer, you should be able to find them at most small-town hardware stores (they always have the BEST selection of canning jars). Again, I recommend the Ball plastic caps to go with them. You can definitely make your oats both vegan and dairy-free! Just make sure to use plant-based milk and yogurt and choose to use maple syrup as your sweetener if shooting for vegan overnight oats. Easy, delicious, and 100% plant-based! Phew! Thats a whole lot of overnight oats recipes and information! I hope you were able to find something in there thatll make your breakfasts a little bit more exciting. Enjoy!",

If you want to make this recipe a little more decadent, you can also add an optional dark chocolate topping. My Obsession With Overnight Oats If you follow me on social media, you will know I am a big fan of overnight oats. Im particularly a fan of blended overnight oats – the consistency is so gooey and it transforms oats into a delicious pudding. This whole obsession really started with my Cookie Dough Blended Oats which went viral on Instagram and TikTok reaching over 4 million views combined! I realized I was onto something and have since made lots of variations so we never have to get bored with breakfast. The other most popular recipes have been my Chocolate Blended Oats with Smash Top and my Raspberry Cheesecake Oats with White Chocolate Ganache.

SPONSORED CONTENT No Passport, No Problem: Uncover Your Perfect Paradise in Puerto Rico. By Discover Puerto Rico Rolled oats Milk of choice (I use soy) Blueberries (frozen or fresh, or a combination. I blend the frozen blueberries but use fresh as a topping) Thick natural or Greek yogurt (I make my own soy yogurt as it is vegan, high in protein and very affordable and surprisingly low effort to make. But you can use any yogurt youd like.) Vanilla extract Maple syrup (or preferred syrup – agave would also work) Salt Dark chocolate (optional) Coconut oil (optional) Check out the recipe card at the bottom of this post for specific quantities for each ingredient. A bowl of rolled oats, blueberries, yogurt and other ingredients for Blueberry Overnight Oats (Blended).

Melted dark chocolate being poured onto blueberry blended oats in a jar. Step Four: Melt the dark chocolate and (if desired), mix in the coconut oil to thin the chocolate (this makes it a bit easier to crack into). Pour the melted chocolate over the blended oats, then set in the fridge overnight or for at least 90 minutes. Substitutions & Variations Milk: You can use any milk youd like. I prefer soy as it has the closest nutritional profile to dairy milk when fortified (read more about plant-milk fortification from Dietitians Australia). The recipe will work fine with any milk though. Almond, oat, or coconut milk are all tasty plant based options, or if youre not vegan, dairy milk also works. Sweeteners: Maple, agave, brown rice syrup or honey (if youre not vegan) would all work well in this recipe. You can omit maple syrup entirely if you prefer a lower-sugar option, or try adding a little bit at a time, then blending and taste testing until youre satisfied. Yogurt: Again, I choose soy for its nutritional profile and I make my own yogurt from scratch (its only 3 ingredients and very hands off – much less effort than youd imagine, I promise). But again, same as milk, you can use any yogurt to suit your dietary preferences and taste. Chocolate topping: This is a completely optional addition to the recipe to make it a little bit more decadent than regular breakfast. It still tastes delicious without this topping, so feel free to omit it. The coconut oil is also optional in the topping – if used, it helps to thin the chocolate so it is easier to crack the chocolate topping once chilled.  Store your oats in individual glass jars or airtight containers in the refrigerator for up to 4 days. Enjoy within the first 2 days for best texture and flavor. The vibrancy of the purple color will fade a little but it will still be fine to eat. If any separation occurs, or a little water pools on top its nothing to worry about – just mix it back in. Expert Tips Smiling woman in green sweater Although you can eat these oats after 90 minutes, if you want an extra creamy texture, let them sit in the refrigerator overnight. This allows the oats to fully absorb the liquid and flavors.",

Nope, this breakfast sandwich recipe freezes perfectly, so you can assemble a weeks worth of sandwiches on the weekend and feast on them all week. If you ask me, its one of the nicest things you can do for your future self. Sitting down to a toasted English muffin slathered with herbed goat cheese and piled with veggies, hot sauce, and a spinach omelet is a real treat on any morning, let alone a busy weekday one. Try making this breakfast sandwich recipe — or even better, making it ahead — and I promise, you wont be disappointed. Small bowl filled with goat cheese, garlic, olive oil, onion powder, and chives Whats in This Breakfast Sandwich Recipe? One of the main components in this breakfast sandwich recipe is a creamy herbed goat cheese spread. Made with goat cheese, chives, garlic, onion powder, olive oil, and salt, its kinda reminiscent of a chive cream cheese, though the goat cheese gives it a little more complexity and funk. Creamy chive and goat cheese spread in small bowl I love that its super easy to make. Just add all the ingredients to a small bowl, and stir to combine! Hand using spatula to fold spinach omelet in skillet The next major piece is a spinach omelet. Youll make it by sautéeing spinach in a nonstick skillet, then pouring in beaten eggs. Cook the eggs over medium-low heat, without stirring, until they begin to set. Then, run a spatula around the edges of the omelet and let some of the raw egg on top of the omelet run to the edges of the pan. Repeat until the omelet is nearly set.

Breakfast sandwich recipe ingredients At this point, youre ready to assemble the breakfast sandwiches! Spread the chive goat cheese generously on each side of a toasted English muffin. Add the omelet on top, followed by a tomato slice, avocado, red onions, and microgreens. Other toppings that would be great here? Pickled red onions and pickled jalapeños would both be excellent. You could also sub a slice of cheddar cheese for the goat cheese, or fill the sandwich with sautéed greens and a soft scramble or fried egg instead of the omelet. (But probably stick to the omelet if you want to meal prep this recipe!) Dig in right away, with hot sauce on the side, or see below for make-ahead instructions. Overhead shot of breakfast sandwich assembly scene with toppings, toasted English muffins, bowl of goat cheese spread, and several completed sandwiches How to Meal Prep Breakfast Sandwiches To meal prep this breakfast sandwich recipe, fully assemble the egg sandwiches, but omit the microgreens and avocado, as these ingredients dont freeze and reheat well.

Happily, it turns out the simplest alternative is also the secret to the breakfast sandwich of your dreams: medium firm tofu. fried tofu I think part of the appeal of eggs is their ease of use – crack one into a hot pan and youve got a meal. It turns out this slightly tender tofu, when sliced, lightly salted, and pan fried until golden, is a dead ringer for an egg in both taste and texture (even more so if you add a sprinkle of our favourite eggy seasoning!). Just load up some toast or an English muffin with any combination of dijon, mayo, pesto, avocado, tomato, spinach, veggie bacon, and/or vegan cheese, wrap it around your beautiful golden fried tofu, then just sit back and wonder why people even bother with eggs! These are so easy, you dont really need a recipe, but Ive listed the basics below. Tweak it to taste! Easy Vegan Breakfast Sandwich Prep Time 5 minutes Cook Time 5 minutes Ingredients  Slice tofu into roughly 1/4 – 1/3 inch thick slices, once slice per sandwich. Heat frying pan over medium heat. Add non-dairy butter or oil. Add tofu to the hot pan. Season lightly with salt. Fry for several minutes per side, until golden. While tofu is frying, toast your bread. Spread toasted bread with your choice of condiments (we like any combination of dijon mustard, mayonnaise, or pesto). Place your optional additions on one side of your bread (sliced tomato, avocado, guacamole, veggie bacon, spinach, vegan cheese). Sprinkle tofu with Eggy Seasoning or black salt, if using.

Now add the tofu pieces and cook until its lightly golden and crispy for 2-3 minutes. Flip the tofu and add a slice of cheese on top of each piece. Cover the pan to melt the cheese and brown the other side of the tofu for about 2-3 minutes. To assemble the breakfast sandwich, toast the English muffins and butter each slice. If preferred, you can lightly pan-fry the vegan ham or just leave it as is. Top a slice of tomato on a muffin half, then the tofu, then ham, and add hot sauce if preferred. Close together with the other muffin half and serve immediately. Substitute and Add-On Ideas Instead of Tabasco sauce, you can use Chipotle Sauce, Ketchup, Mayonnaise, Salsa, Avocado Pesto, or your favorite condiment. Exchange the store-bought Vegan Cheese for my Vegan Nacho Cheese, my Vegan Hollandaise Sauce, or Vegan Cream Cheese. Instead of English Muffins, you can use Sandwich Bread, Vegan Bagels, or a Baguette. You can switch out the Vegan Ham for Vegan Turkey, Vegan Sausage Patties, or Baked Tempeh Bacon. Add more flavor and fun with Sandwich Pickles, Jalapeños, Sliced Avocado, Leafy Greens, or Quick Pickled Red Onions. Vegan breakfast sandwich on a white plate with tabasco sauce in the background.

Cut each slice into a circle using a glass or cookie cutter (you can save the scraps for tofu crumbles). You can also cut the tofu into squares instead - just make sure it fits the muffins or bread youve chosen. In a small shallow bowl (that will fit one tofu circle), add the nutritional yeast, garlic, onion, paprika, turmeric, salt and pepper. Whisk to combine well. Place a piece of tofu into the dry mixture and gently move around to coat well. Flip and repeat on the other side. Repeat with the remaining tofu.

        "text": "8-Layer Breakfast Sandwich by: ERIN ALEXANDER May 31, 2019 5 5 out of 5 stars / 3 Ratings5 total ratings / View 5 Reviews 8-Layer Breakfast Sandwich PHOTO BY TY MECHAM SAVE TO COLLECTION REVIEW PRINT Rate this recipe: PREP TIME 10 minutes COOK TIME 45 minutes SERVES 1 (or 2, depending on how hungry you are)  AUTHOR NOTES The best breakfast sandwich I have ever tasted (and possibly ever will taste) comes from a cute little restaurant called the Sunny Side Café in Berkeley, California. Dubbed The Alameda, this sandwich is an absolute behemoth—its got two slices of thick, not-sweet French toast, between which are stuffed roasted tomatoes, sautéed mushrooms, a pile of Hickory-smoked ham, and melty Swiss cheese. But thats not all. To take it completely over the top, you add two sunny-side up eggs on top and drizzle hollandaise sauce and a tangy balsamic reduction over the whole thing. Since I havent been able to find anything remotely similar in New York City, where I live now, I had to try and recreate the recipe at home. Its a multi-step process for sure, but so long as you have each component prepped (slice the vegetables, crack the eggs, etc.) its really just a matter of working your way through the steps. My version has some adaptations: Ive swapped out the ham for bacon (because its crispy and I love it); added in spinach (because any dish this rich could always use a bit of greenery); and pan-seared the tomatoes instead of roasting them (it only takes a few minutes). Also, I like to use white bread, but you can use just about any bread you have on hand; I bet challah or brioche would be amazing. I like to make the hollandaise sauce (I used Eric Riperts blender method) and balsamic reduction first so that I can put together the rest of the recipe in a single skillet. Speaking of skillets, youll want to use one thats super nonstick—itll make pan-roasting the tomatoes and flipping the sunny-side up eggs (without cracking the yolk) so much easier. —Erin Alexander TEST KITCHEN NOTES This recipe is featured in The Epic, 8-Layer Breakfast Sandwich I Dream About, sponsored by Pete & Gerrys Eggs. —The Editors Test Kitchen-Approved What Youll Need Dansk Købenstyle Large Baker exclusive Dansk Købenstyle Large Baker $138 more colors Maison Plus Heavyweight Gold Measuring Cups & Spoons Set Maison Plus Heavyweight Gold Measuring Cups & Spoons Set $74 Mosser 3-Piece Colored Glass Mixing Bowl Set exclusive Mosser 3-Piece Colored Glass Mixing Bowl Set $89–$115 more colors Staub Enameled Cast-Iron Traditional Deep Skillet, 11 exclusive Staub Enameled Cast-Iron Traditional Deep Skillet, 11 $250–$270 more colors Margrethe Nested Mixing Bowls With Lids exclusive Margrethe Nested Mixing Bowls With Lids $62–$110 more options Faux Floral Stems, Set of 3 only a few left Faux Floral Stems, Set of 3 $41–$94 more options Multi-Surface Broom & Dustpan exclusive Multi-Surface Broom & Dustpan $85 more colors Five Two Everyday Soft Cotton Cloth Napkins our line!

Warm the blender bowl by filling with hot water and then emptying and drying the bowl. Add the egg yolks, lemon juice, salt, and pepper and blend at medium speed. Slowly drizzle in the hot melted butter with the machine still running until emulsified. Store in a covered container in a warm spot; if it start to curdle, add a drop or two of hot water and stir. Make the balsamic reduction: Add the balsamic vinegar to a small saucepan. Bring the balsamic vinegar up to a boil, then reduce it to a simmer for about 10 to 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. The sauce should be thick enough to just coat a spoon. Store in a covered container in a warm spot. Make the savory French toast: In a wide bowl, whisk together 1 egg, heavy cream, plus a pinch of salt and pepper. Dredge the two slices of white bread to lighty coat them in the mixture; you dont want it to soak too long so that it gets mushy in the center. Set a large nonstick skillet over medium heat and melt 1 tablespoon butter and the canola oil. Once the butter is lightly bubbling, cook the French toast until it is nicely browned on one side. Then, flip it and then cook it until it is nicely browned on the other side. Do this one at a time if your skillet isnt large enough to hold both slices of bread. Once the French toast is done, set aside on a plate. Pan-sear the tomatoes: Using the same skillet, turn the heat to medium-high, and place the tomato slices in the pan in a single layer (they shouldnt overlap). Cook for about 2 to 3 minutes on side; once they look browned, flip to the other side and cook for 2 to 3 minutes more. Set aside on the same plate with the French toast when done. Turn the skillet down to medium heat and melt 1 tablespoon of butter. Sauté the mushrooms until they are just tender, about 3 minutes. Add the spinach to the skillet and sauté until just barely wilted. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and set aside on the plate. Leave the skillet at medium heat and cook the bacon until its crispy on both sides. Set aside the slices of bacon on a paper-towel-lined plate and cut each slice in half (so it fits better in the sandwich). Turn off the heat and drain the bacon fat into a heat-safe bowl; wipe down the skillet with a paper towel (you can leave a little bacon fat in there to cook the eggs if youd like). Leaving the skillet at medium heat, melt 1 tablespoon of butter. When the butter is bubbling and foamy, carefully crack the 2 eggs into the skillet. Cook until the egg whites are just set, but the yolk is still runny. Gently flip over and cook for about 10-20 seconds. Set aside. Turn the heat down to low and assemble the sandwich: I like to use this order: start with one slice savory French toast, stack tomato, bacon, mushrooms, spinach, 2 slices of Swiss cheese, and top with other French toast slice. Warm up the sandwich in the skillet and cover, heating it until the cheese is melted. Set the sandwich on a plate and top it with the sunny-side up eggs. Drizzle with hollandaise sauce and balsamic reduction. Enjoy! Youve earned it.",

A family favorite made with toasted English muffins, creamy herbed eggs, flavorful cheddar, and thin cut deli ham folded into layers to perfectly fit. Such a tasty way to start the day! Stack of breakfast sandwiches. A Simple Homemade Breakfast Sandwich This is a classic breakfast sandwich with a few upgrades (hello herbs and cream!) plus a few simple swaps to make them faster (using stovetop scrambled eggs and pre-cooked meat like deli ham). They are a classic morning comfort food and make a super satisfying lazy Saturday morning breakfast. They dont require any special cooking skill, and they are one of those breakfasts that everyone can agree on. Plus Ive shared lots of other options to switch them up including various filling ideas and cooking methods because this is the ever-so-versatile breakfast sandwich after all. The key to the recipe is just that you dont walk away while they are toasting under the broiler and forget about them. I think we all have at least one memory of doing that to that blackened piece of garlic bread or what not. These are much too good to be wasted to charring. Watch the Video! Breakfast sandwiches sliced in half. Breakfast sandwich ingredients. Breakfast Sandwich Recipe Ingredients See below for full recipe with amounts. English muffins: White, wheat or sourdough Eggs: Pasture raised are best. Heavy cream: Half and half can be substituted. Salt and black pepper Parsley and chives: Fresh herbs will give best flavor but in a pinch use 1/3 the amount dried. Deli ham: I like black forest or Tavern ham but honey or maple ham is fine too. Cheddar cheese: See cheese note below for more options. Cooking spray: Olive oil or avocado oil spray will be best. Hot sauce: This is optional for a little kick. Scrambled eggs in a skillet. How to Make Eggs for a Breakfast Sandwich Stovetop (recipe method) In a mixing bowl using a fork whisk together eggs, heavy cream, parsley, chives, salt and pepper until combined. Spray a 12-inch non-stick skillet with cooking spray. Heat over medium-low heat and add eggs. Cook, and stir until curds begin to form, scoot to shape into a square about 7-inches. Cut into 4 portions then turn each portion to cook on the opposite side. Remove from heat before eggs have reached desired doneness as theyll continue to cook from residual heat of pan. Oven (alternative method): Use 8 eggs, 3 Tbsp cream, 3 Tbsp parsley, 2 Tbsp chives (salt and pepper to taste). This makes enough for 6 breakfast sandwiches or 4 sandwiches plus 2 servings of leftover eggs. Heat oven to 350 and a grease 9 by 9 baking dish. Pour scrambled egg mixture into baking dish and bake about 15 minutes until eggs are set. Cut into 6 squares. Microwave (alternative single method): For 1 breakfast sandwich follow my microwave scrambled eggs option here (you can add herbs and use cream for milk). Breakfast sandwiches with english muffins, ham, cheese and eggs. How to Make a Breakfast Sandwich Cook eggs using one of the methods directed above. Heat oven broiler: Set an oven rack one level above center and preheat oven broiler to LOW broil. If you dont have low broil option then just use the standard high option and keep oven rack in center of oven. Toast English muffins: Place English muffins on a baking sheet, split side up. Transfer to oven and let toast until golden brown, about 1 minute (keep a close eye on them dont walk away). Heat with cheese and ham: Remove from oven, spray each cut side with cooking spray. Place cheese slices on four of the halves, then on the other four fold and layer ham slices (2 slices on each of the four). Return to oven and let broil until cheese has melted nicely, about 1 to 2 minutes (again keep a close eye on them dont walk away). Assemble breakfast sandwiches by layering each cooked egg portion over ham on english muffin, add hot sauce to taste if desired, then top with the cheese covered English muffin. Serve right away. Finished breakfast sandwich. Possible Variations Bread Base: In place of english muffin you can also make these with toasted bagels (plain, wheat, multi-grain, everything, sesame), croissants, bread slices, ciabatta, or even smaller naan. Meats: Cooked breakfast sausage patties (such as Jimmy Dean), turkey sausage, or Italian sausage will work in place of ham (pre-cook in skillet instead of oven). Or use cooked bacon (pork or turkey bacon), cooked chorizo, or leftover roast ham slices or deli turkey. Cheese: Other delicious cheeses to use are Swiss, gruyere, Monterey jack, havarti, provolone, gouda, fontina, muenster or American. Eggs: While theres not much of a substitute for eggs (unless you are swapping all the fillings to vegan), you can switch up the cooking method and try with fried sunnyside eggs, boiled eggs (sliced), microwave scrambled eggs, poached eggs, or baked eggs. Herbs: Try with other herbs in place of those Ive included here including chervil, tarragon, basil, thyme, or dill (keep in mind the flavor combo you are looking for between type of meat, cheese and herbs). Add vegetables: For an upgrade try them with sliced or mashed avocado, sliced tomatoes, arugula, spinach, or sauteed bell peppers or mushrooms. Helpful Make Ahead Tips If youd like to prepare these as freezer breakfast sandwiches then instead skip the toasting steps and just assemble after cooking the eggs (with raw cheese, deli ham or cooked bacon or cooked sausage). Wrap in foil and store in an airtight container in the freezer up to 3 months or in the fridge for 4 days. To heat: Thaw in fridge overnight then remove foil and heat in the microwave on microwave safe plate until warmed through, about 1 minute. Or bake in the oven in the foil at 400 degrees for about 10 minutes. Breakfast sandwiches shown in a stack close up.

Omg…this vegan breakfast sandwich is so yummy, filling, nutritious and is a great plant-based alternative to a traditional breakfast sandwich. This has all the flavor without any of the cholesterol or cruelty. Meat-free, egg-free and dairy-free…still so delish! I made one breakfast sandwich for myself and one for my boyfriend, we both gobbled them up! These vegan breakfast sandwiches are super filling and will keep you full for HOURS (without being heavy)! If you know you need to be on the go all day and need something substantial, you should give this a try! This recipe is: ✔️Vegan ✔️Plant-based ✔️Oil-free ✔️Gluten-free optional ✔️100% yummy Essentials If youre adding tempeh bacon to this sandwich, I would recommend the organic one from Trader Joes but any tempeh will work. Tempeh is high in protein, fiber and is great for gut health because it is fermented. For the english muffins, I used the organic sprouted ezekiel english muffins – if you are gluten intolerant or want to keep this gluten-free, you can use the gluten-free version of these by the Food for Life brand! Also, the egg of this vegan breakfast sandwich is made from tofu. I get the organic non-gmo tofu from Trader Joes, it is very high in plant-based protein. To add some freshness to this vegan breakfast sandwich, I added tomato and mashed avocado. Tomato is filled with vitamin C, lycopene and disease fighting antioxidants. Avocado is a great healthy fat that adds an amazing texture to this! I used a cup to shape the tofu into a circle so it would fit perfectly on the english muffin. Also, feel free to use thick or thin slices of tomato…totally up to you! You can either slice or mash the avocado, I chose to mash it. The tofu egg is the perfect egg alternative, it gives a similar texture and mild taste. In addition, I added anti-inflammatory promoting turmeric to my tofu egg as well as salt and pepper. Have you ever tried a tofu egg?! Tell me in the comments. This was my sandwich. Bottom layer – avocado Middle layer – tofu egg Save this for later? Well email this post to you, so you can come back to it later! Top layer – tomato OMG…could it be any more beautiful?! Your typical standard American breakfast sandwich is filled with cholesterol, saturated fat, sodium, processed meat and cheese and everything that promotes heart disease, diabetes and cancer. You need to try MY healthy version of a breakfast sandwich! You wont be disappointed. My boyfriends sandwich. He wanted tempeh bacon on his so that is just what I did! This is actually smokey maple tempeh bacon…its DELISH! This sandwich was stacked! Just how we like it! 1st layer – avocado 2nd layer – tofu egg 3rd layer – tomato slices 4th layer – tempeh bacon YUM!

This easy low carb vanilla ice cream tastes unbelievably creamy - a dessert staple for any time of the year. A cup of vanilla ice cream topped with chocolate sauce and chopped hazelnuts. Do you love ice cream? I can eat it all year round, summer or winter. I think its a great sweet treat when Ive got friends over. There are not many people wholl pass on a scoop of ice cream after dinner, especially when it is topped with a decadent chocolate drizzle! I have yet to find a sugar free ice cream in the shops that I like to eat. All brands use either sweeteners such as sorbitol, maltodextrin or maltitol which raises your blood sugar levels or contain artificial ingredients which make them taste strangely fake. It boils down to this: if you want to eat an ice cream made without added sugar containing real, simple ingredients, youve got to make it yourself. The good news is, homemade low carb ice cream tastes incredibly delicious AND its easy to make! You need a bit of patience - it needs a few hours to cool and set - but it is well worth the wait. Jump to: Ingredients Equipment  Serving Suggestion Tips For Soft Keto Ice Cream Recipe FAQs  More Ice Cream Recipes Recipe Ingredients Incredibly, you only need 5 ingredients for this recipe! It is packed with the most beautiful vanilla flavor. Dairy Cream Almond Milk Egg Yolks Sweetener Vanilla Lets discuss the ingredients: It is possible to use regular vanilla extract in this recipe, but it is the vanilla bean that takes it to the next level. Trust me - try and get hold of a couple of pods. You can find them in the baking section of good supermarkets. Some Keto ice cream recipes use only heavy cream or even butter and forego the traditional route of making a custard with milk and eggs. Whilst this is an easy solution to increase the fat content and creaminess, I do not like their texture. I find that too much fat in ice cream can leave an unpleasant taste on the tongue. By adding in the almond milk, youre keeping the calories lower at 330 per serving. The net carbs are only 2.3g per portion! Which Sweetener Is Best? Allulose is hands down the best sweetener for sugar-free ice cream. It is not a sugar alcohol, but a rare sugar that is not metabolized, making it zero carb. It does not recrystallize, keeping the ice cream lovely and soft. Sugar alcohols such as erythritol can be used, but need to be powdered. Low carb sweeteners re-crystallize when they cool and you dont want any crunchy bits in your ice cream! So take note: Erythritol blends that also contain the natural contain monk fruit extract or stevia taste great, but they will set hard once the ice cream has been in the freezer overnight. Bocha Sweet produces great results for keto ice cream, keeping it much creamier than erythritol. I have not tried Splenda as it contains the artificial sweetener Sucralose which I am sensitive to. A hand taking a spoonful of vanilla ice cream decorated with chocolate and nuts Equipment This recipe is designed to be used with an ice cream maker. I know an ice-cream maker takes up space and you might not be keen on yet another kitchen appliance. But if you love sugar free ice cream and have enough people about the house whod like to eat it on a regular basis its definitely a worth-while investment. The ones that require pre-freezing of the mixing canister are reasonable (we used one of these in the video). If you dont mind spending a little more, invest in a machine with a compressor. It makes restaurant-quality gelato on demand. It is possible to make great-tasting no-churn sugar free ice cream, as I have done with this chocolate avocado ice cream. This recipe uses a mix of coconut milk and whipped cream. However, the result will never be as smooth and creamy as ice cream made in an ice cream maker. Also, its a lot more involved. Youll have to stir it in regular intervals whilst its chilling in the freezer to break up the ice crystals.

All ingredients we want to stay away from! Here are my tips for soft low carb ice cream: SHALLOW CONTAINER: Store homemade ice cream in a shallow container and not a in deep one. Always cover the ice cream with cling film. This prevents ice crystals from forming. ALLULOSE. My top tip for creamy keto ice cream is to use allulose as a sweetener. Other sweeteners do work as well, as long as they are powdered. However, in terms of creaminess, allulose will give you a silky ice cream that is scoopable. VODKA. Another tip is to add 2 teaspoons of vodka or another spirit with a high alcohol content. MCT OIL. This is a high grade coconut oil that remains liquid even when cold. I have not tried it in this particular recipe, but ¼ cup (4 tbsp) should do the trick. XANTHAN GUM. Try ¼ teaspoon for this recipe! Recipe FAQs Is this an ice cream for diabetics?

Its thick, incredibly creamy & requires just 2 minutes of prep! The ULTIMATE Healthy Chocolate Ice Cream -- just 85 calories & 8g+ of protein! It tastes so rich & like it came from a fancy ice cream parlor, not healthy at all! SO easy to make too! On a spur-of-the-moment whim last Sunday, my mom and I decided to attend an Oakland As baseball game. We purchased season tickets for the past two years, but because we skipped this season, weve start to go through withdrawals… We let three weeks go by since our last baseball game, and that was far too long! We picked seats in our favorite section (just beyond the As dugout and even with the bag at third base), directly on the aisle to avoid climbing over other fans for bathroom and concession stand breaks. After greeting our favorite usher with big smiles and hugs, we settled in to cheer on our boys with the rest of the crowd. As a pitchers duel (aka a low-scoring game, for those of you not quite as obsessed with baseball as I am!), we saw plenty of spectacular defensive plays from both teams. Diving catches, leaping grabs, speeding fastballs, line-drove comebackers… It felt like we applauded for something amazing at every other at-bat (oops… every other players turn, if you arent familiar with baseball terms!), which really worked up our appetites! The ULTIMATE Healthy Chocolate Ice Cream -- just 85 calories & 8g+ of protein! It tastes so rich & like it came from a fancy ice cream parlor, not healthy at all! SO easy to make too! With the temperature above 80°F and not a cloud in the sky, vendors walked up and down the aisles offering plenty of cold, refreshing treats to the fans sweltering in the heat. Snow cones, iced tea, frozen lemonade, bottles of soda… But as huge chocoholics (I inherited that from my mom!), the chocolate malts, Häagen-Dazs dark chocolate ice cream bars, and Nestlé ice cream drumsticks really caught our eye! Although the fans around us readily caved and purchased those sweets, Mom and I tried to summon the willpower to avoid the temptation. Although it felt virtually impossible… The ULTIMATE Healthy Chocolate Ice Cream -- just 85 calories & 8g+ of protein! It tastes so rich & like it came from a fancy ice cream parlor, not healthy at all! SO easy to make too! It was a lot easier when I remembered I could make a batch of this Ultimate Healthy Chocolate Ice Cream when we returned home! Its rich, smooth, and creamy, just like anything youd find at an ice cream parlor. Its also super easy and quick to make — and secretly full of protein! I think Ill celebrate that with another scoop! 😉 The ULTIMATE Healthy Chocolate Ice Cream -- just 85 calories & 8g+ of protein! It tastes so rich & like it came from a fancy ice cream parlor, not healthy at all! SO easy to make too! The ULTIMATE Healthy Chocolate Ice Cream -- just 85 calories & 8g+ of protein! It tastes so rich & like it came from a fancy ice cream parlor, not healthy at all! SO easy to make too! HOW TO MAKE THE BEST HEALTHY CHOCOLATE ICE CREAM For the base of your healthier ice cream, youll use Greek yogurt and 2% milk. If youve been around AHB for a while, you know how much I love Greek yogurt! Its thick and creamy, making it perfect for this ice cream, and it also adds a big protein boost. One cup of Greek yogurt contains about 21g of protein! I highly recommend that you use 2% milk, as the recipe calls for. This is because ice cream needs a certain amount of fat in order to be smooth and creamy. Without it, your ice cream would be grainy and icy. I explain more about that (and why its so important!) over here. Note: I do not recommend substituting almond milk or cashew milk. These have a high water content, so they would have the same effect on your ice creams texture as nonfat or 1% milk. The ULTIMATE Healthy Chocolate Ice Cream -- just 85 calories & 8g+ of protein! It tastes so rich & like it came from a fancy ice cream parlor, not healthy at all! SO easy to make too! For the chocolate flavor, youll mix in cocoa powder. Yes, just regular unsweetened cocoa powder—no melted chocolate! I wanted to make this ice cream recipe as easy as possible for you to whip up. Youll add in a full ½ cup of cocoa powder, so your ice cream will still taste very rich and decadent. Tip: I dont recommend substituting Dutched or special dark cocoa powder. These have a different acidity level, which can affect the flavor and consistency of your ice cream. They also tend to make this ice cream taste more muted and bland, compared to the really decadent and rich flavor of regular unsweetened cocoa powder. To sweeten the ice cream, youll use another one of my favorite ingredients: liquid stevia. Stevia is a plant-based, no-calorie sweetener thats clean eating friendly, and its highly concentrated. Youll only need 1 ½ teaspoons for this entire batch of ice cream—thats the equivalent of ¾ cup of sugar! This is the kind that I buy because I love its sweet flavor, and I dont notice any strange aftertastes like with some other stevia products. You can find it at many health-oriented grocery stores, but I usually buy it online here because thats the best price Ive found. (And youll use it in all of these recipes of mine, too!) The ULTIMATE Healthy Chocolate Ice Cream -- just 85 calories & 8g+ of protein! It tastes so rich & like it came from a fancy ice cream parlor, not healthy at all! SO easy to make too! Theres one last important ingredient in this ice cream base. Eggs act as a natural glue that helps hold together traditional ice cream bases and therefore create that perfect smooth, creamy texture. Because were skipping the eggs (Im impatient and dont want to heat my ice cream base—I just want to eat my frozen dessert as soon as possible!), youll use a different glue called xanthan gum. You can find it at many health-oriented grocery stores, as well as online. Do not skip the xanthan gum. Your ice cream will taste icy and hard without it. (You can read more of my nerdy explanation of that here!) Now all thats left is to turn on your ice cream maker (I own this one — its really inexpensive and I love it!), pour in that chocolaty milk mixture, wait for 20 minutes or less, and… The ULTIMATE Healthy Chocolate Ice Cream -- just 85 calories & 8g+ of protein!

The Ultimate Healthy Chocolate Ice Cream © Amys Healthy Baking This rich chocolate ice cream tastes just as indulgent as the kind sold in ice cream parlors! And the fact that its ready just 25 minutes after you start measuring the ingredients? Pure bliss! This ice cream is best if eaten the same day its made, but itll keep if stored in an airtight container in the freezer for at least 2 months. (It will turn somewhat icy and hard if left for too long in the freezer. However, you can minimize that by letting it thaw on the counter for a few minutes or microwaving it for 10-30 seconds, depending on the wattage of your microwave, before enjoying at a later date!)  For more information regarding the ingredients and why theyre critical to achieving the smooth, creamy texture of the ice cream, please read my blog post here. MILK NOTES + ALTERNATIVES: You can use higher percentages of milk (i.e. whole milk) or coconut milk if you prefer. I do not recommend substituting nonfat milk, 1% milk, almond milk, and cashew milk. Any of these will result in ice cream with a less smooth and creamy texture. COCOA POWDER NOTES: For more of a dark chocolate flavor, add an additional 2-3 tablespoons (10-15g) of cocoa powder. I do not recommend substituting Dutched or special dark cocoa powder. These have a different acidity level, which can affect the flavor and consistency of your ice cream. They also tend to make this ice cream taste more muted and bland, compared to the really decadent and rich flavor of regular unsweetened cocoa powder. STEVIA NOTES: For sweeter ice cream, increase the liquid stevia by ¼ to ½ teaspoon. (I highly recommend using it! Its one of my favorite ingredients, and youll use it in all of these recipes of mine, too! I buy it here because thats the cheapest price Ive found.) I have not tried substituting other sweeteners and do not know how they will turn out. If you prefer not to use the liquid stevia, youll need the equivalent of ½ to ¾ cup granulated sugar. XANTHAN GUM NOTE: I do not recommend skipping the xanthan gum. Without it, your ice cream will taste icy and hard rather than smooth and creamy. ICE CREAM MAKER RECOMMENDATIONS + NOTES: To achieve the best smooth and creamy texture, the ice cream should be made in an ice cream maker. This is the wonderful and affordable one I own. (I have two of them!) If you dont own one, use the method below (but keep in mind that the ice cream will turn out with a grainier and harder texture). After about 10 minutes, I found that my ice cream started getting stuck and wasnt churning around the ice cream maker. If that happens to you, carefully help it along by gently pressing down with a small spatula to get the ice cream moving around the ice cream makers bowl. (I did that very frequently for the last 10 minutes of freezing!) NO ICE CREAM MAKER METHOD: After Step 2, add the mixture to an 8-square baking pan, and place in the freezer, ensuring that the pan is flat and level. Freezer for 2-3 hours, vigorously stirring with a spatula for 2-4 minutes every 30 minutes to break up any chunks and mix air into the ice cream. STORAGE TIPS: This ice cream is best if eaten the same day its made, but itll keep if stored in an airtight container in the freezer for at least 2 months. It will turn somewhat icy and hard after being stored in the freezer. However, you can minimize that by letting it thaw on the counter for a few minutes before scooping and eating it OR by microwaving it for 10-30 seconds (depending on the wattage of your microwave) before enjoying at a later date! {gluten free, clean eating, low fat, low calorie, low sugar, higher protein} View  Information + Weight Watchers Points You may also like Amys other recipes… ♡ The Ultimate Healthy Vanilla Ice Cream ♡ Healthier Cookies n Cream Ice Cream ♡ Healthy Chai Spice Ice Cream ♡ Healthy Pumpkin Spice Latte Ice Cream ♡ Healthier Brownie Bark Mini Ice Cream Sandwiches ♡ Skinny Strawberry Cheesecake Frozen Greek Yogurt Sandwiches ♡ Healthy Cookie Dough Frozen Yogurt ♡ Lightened Up Mini Hula Pie Ice Cream Desserts ♡ Lightened Up Blueberry & Cherry Ice Cream Sandwiches ♡ Healthy Fudgy Triple Chocolate Cookies ♡ The Ultimate Healthy Dark Chocolate Cupcakes",

As a result, finding a way to make my ice cream without adding sugar to it was very important to me. This recipe does remind me of my Sugar Free Chocolate Ice Cream recipe.

This recipe for homemade ice cream does not necessarily require that you use an ice cream maker. You will need a freezer-safe container for ice cream which you can find here. This recipe is especially for anyone asking is there such a thing as sugar free ice cream. Being someone who was raised on ice cream that was often loaded with sugar, this was something that I too was wondering about. However, what I did find out was that yes, there is a way to make ice cream without adding sugar to it. Technically, if you do not add sugar to the recipe, or anything that contains sugar, then it is totally sugar free, But, when it comes to something like ice cream, sometimes ingredients that have the sugar also has the fat that makes ice cream so enjoyable. I personally prefer ice cream that is not laden with fat or sugar because I do not enjoy that heavy feeling that ice cream can give me after eating it. Here is how to make this sugar free ice cream soft. The sugar or corn syrup that is added to regular ice cream helps to make this ice cream softer for easier scooping and eating. Since we are not adding any of these ingredients to this recipe, besides allowing your ice cream to soften before serving it, you could also set your ice cream shallower by using an extra ice cream freezer storage container. This ice cream is made with heavy cream or heavy whipping cream. Heavy cream is high in fat yet, lower in carbohydrates making it great for using in ice cream as it is what gives ice cream that thick and rich texture. You could however substitute in half and half for part or all of the heavy cream taking into consideration that this may affect the consistency of your ice cream. Here are some tips for making ice cream. I just mentioned that filling your ice cream freezer storage container halfway and using an extra one if needed can help make softer ice cream. Also, using half and half rather than heavy whipping cream, aka heavy cream, can help keep the fat content down but, can also make this consistency less like ice cream. Here are some more helpful tips for you. Add some flavor to this recipe by adding a bit of extract (1-2 tsp). I like a banana extract or mint extract with this recipe. Feel free to add some goodies to this ice cream. I am referring to chopped nuts, sugar free chocolate chips, or even chopped up sugar free candy! Adding additional goodies works best stirring them in after the other ingredients have been allowed to set. You did not hear this from me but, I have heard that adding a bit of alcohol such as a flavored liqueur (teaspoon or two) can also help make your ice cream soft. There is more than one way to make this ice cream. Certainly, using an ice cream maker is almost always going to be the easiest way to make ice cream.

Be sure to look for full fat canned coconut milk, not lite coconut milk or the cartons of coconutmilk beverage sold in the dairy case. I have not tried substituting heavy cream. Sugar free options that work well for the sweetener include granulated erythritol or xylitol, a low-glycemic and natural sugar alternative with 40% fewer calories that is absorbed more slowly than sugar and doesnt have the same effect on insulin or blood sugar levels.

Its umami, cheesy taste, and health benefits make it a fantastic addition to many savory meals. Soy Milk: A protein-packed plant-based milk alternative. It can be replaced by another neutral dairy-free milk, such as oat or almond milk. Butter beans: A great source of protein and fiber. The soft texture of the butter beans makes it a delicious replacement for chicken in this dish. Step-By-Step  Begin by cooking the lentil pasta as per the packet instructions. Blend the cashews, nutritional yeast, and soy milk, setting it aside for later. Sauté the onions in olive oil for about 5 minutes on medium heat. Add bell pepper, garlic, and sun-dried tomatoes, cooking them on reduced heat. Stir in the butter beans, tomato paste, and spices and let it simmer, stirring regularly. Add the cashew cream and cook for two minutes. Finish by adding the pasta, spinach, lemon juice, and parsley. Stir until the spinach wilts, and voila, your High-Protein Vegan Marry Me Pasta is ready! Sautéing mix of red and yellow bell peppers and onions for High-Protein Vegan Marry Me Pasta Golden cashew sauce poured over veggies in preparation for High-Protein Vegan Marry Me Pasta Pot full of High-Protein Vegan Marry Me Pasta ready to be served Variations And Tips Veggies: For extra veggies, add mushrooms or zucchini. For an earthy flavor, add a mix of shiitake and portobello mushrooms. Spice It Up: If you love heat, consider adding a dash of cayenne pepper or a spoonful of chili flakes. Nut-Free: If youre allergic to cashews, try using sunflower seeds for the creamy sauce. Soak Cashews: For a smoother sauce, soak the cashews overnight in cold water or at least for 30 minutes in boiling water. If you have a high-speed blender, such as the one Im using in the video, it doesnt matter as much, but it can make a big difference if using a less powerful blender. Reheating: When reheating, you may want to add a splash of plant-based milk to bring back the creamy consistency. Gluten-Free: This recipe uses red lentil pasta, which is gluten-free. Serving Suggestion: This pasta pairs wonderfully with a side of sauteed greens such as broccolini or a simple green salad.

You can even use home-cooked dried beans. Leafy greens - I think kale works best because its sturdy and flavourful but you can use any other leafy greens such as collard greens, chard, mustard greens, beet leaves, or even broccoli raab. If using spinach though add it in the last 5 minutes. Dried herbs - I like thyme or rosemary but you can use any sturdy herbs that you enjoy the flavour of. If youve got fresh herbs you can use those instead. Chili flakes - Sometimes called red pepper flakes. These are to give a little tiny kick. There is no real heat in this recipe but feel free to omit them if you need to. Stock - Make sure its a tasty one. This is such a simple recipe that a good flavour is important. Lemon - This is essential to amp up the flavour and give some brightness. Expert Tip - For a special occasion use ½ to 1 cup (120 to 240ml) white wine in place of some of the stock.

Latest Recipe Video! 🥘 Ingredients My easy peanut butter bliss balls recipe calls for just 5 nutritious ingredients, all easily found in your pantry or local grocery store. Heres what you need: ingredients for healthy, easy, vegan peanut butter bliss balls recipe Oats: Ive found that rolled oats work best for these kid-friendly bliss balls. I dont recommend using oat flour or quick oats as it wont have the same texture as whole oats, and wont hold up as well. Natural Peanut Butter: I use creamy peanut butter to bind all the ingredients together and add a boost of protein to these energy bites. If you dont have peanut butter, try almond butter as a 1:1 substitute. Other nut butters (like cashew butter or a mixed nut butter) should also work in place of peanut butter, but the bites might have a slightly different consistency since some nuts create a thinner or runnier butter than others! Dark Chocolate Chips: I prefer using dark chocolate chips for a healthier choice. These can be regular or mini chocolate chips. To keep this recipe vegan-friendly, Ill use dairy-free chocolate chips. If you dont need these to be vegan, then semisweet, white chocolate, or milk chocolate chips are all yummy options. Maple Syrup: The only added sugar is natural maple syrup which gives the bliss balls a slightly sweet taste. If you dont have maple syrup on hand, agave, raw honey, or vegan honey work. Vanilla Extract: Pure vanilla extract brings out the richness of the chocolate. Sometimes I also add a pinch of salt to really enhance the sweetness. For a nutty flavor, try using almond extract. 🔪 How To Make Peanut Butter Bliss Balls My vegan no bake peanut butter balls are so easy to make – theyre ready in just 3 simple steps. Let me show you how to make these healthy dessert balls: Combine Ingredients: In a large bowl, using a wooden spoon, I start by stirring together the oats, peanut butter, chocolate chips, maple syrup, vanilla, and salt until combined. peanut butter and chocolate chips being mixed in a bowl Form The Bliss Balls: Next, I line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Taking small handfuls of the mixture, I roll them into small balls 1-2 inches in size – about the size of a golf ball or ping pong ball. I prefer to use a cookie scoop to make this step extra easy. Place each ball onto the baking sheet. no bake energy balls being rolled and placed on parchment paper Let The Balls Set: Once rolled, I refrigerate these peanut butter snack balls for 30 minutes or until solid. no bake peanut butter bliss balls on parchment paper 💭 Expert Tips My #1 Secret Tip for this recipe is to make sure you measure ingredients precisely, with the right ratio of wet to dry ingredients. While there is a little wiggle room with these bliss balls due to them being a no-bake recipe, I recommend being precise with all measurements to ensure ensures that the mixture has the right consistency to hold together without being too sticky or crumbly. The creamy peanut butter is critical as the binding ingredient for these bliss balls, and I find it to be especially important to measure correctly. Too much or too little will throw the whole recipe off, leading to a mixture that is either too wet and sticky or too dry and crumbly. After trial and error, I have found that achieving this balance is important for forming perfect bliss balls that stay intact and have a great texture. Other Tips To Keep In Mind: Use The Right Tools: I like to use a cookie scoop to get all of these no-bake bliss balls the same size and to help my hands stay mess free! Check The Oats: If you or someone in your family is gluten intolerant, be sure to check the packaging on your oats for gluten-free certification. Some oats can be at risk for contamination with gluten substances. Involve The Kiddos: My kids love to help out in the kitchen, and this no-bake recipe is perfect for kids of all ages! They can learn how to measure out ingredients, combine ingredients, and roll the mixture into perfect ball shapes! Adjust For Moisture: If the dough seems too wet to mold into balls, consider adding a tablespoon or two of oat flour or almond flour. This will help to firm the mixture up so that it holds its shape and doesnt stick to your hands. Bliss Balls For Kids: If you want to make these as toddler peanut butter balls I recommend reducing or omitting the sugar! You might also want to cut them into smaller bites when serving. 📖 Variations Ive perfected a few easy swaps and add-ins for when Im looking to switch up the taste or texture a bit with these healthy kid-friendly bliss balls. There is something for any occasion! Here are my favorite variations: Peanut Butter Protein Balls: If you want to turn these peanut butter protein bliss balls, consider adding a scoop of vegan vanilla protein powder to the batter before mixing it. You can use up to 2 scoops of protein powder, depending on the flavor of the protein powder you use. Sometimes I also add 1 tablespoon of ground chia seeds, flax seed, or hemp seeds for an extra boost of protein and healthy fats. Chocolate Bliss Balls With Peanut Butter: For a double serving of chocolate, add a tablespoon of cacao or cocoa powder to the batter before mixing. I love the rich and indulgent flavor that this gives this recipe! I serve this as a healthy kids dessert often! Peanut Butter Date Bliss Balls: For a sweeter flavor, I like to add a ¼ cup of Medjool dates, soaked and drained. I use a food processor when adding dates so that they are completely incorporated with the peanut butter and oats. Sugar-Free Bliss Balls: If you want to make these no-bake peanut butter balls truly sugar-free, you can omit the maple syrup and use sugar-free chocolate. I think they still taste pretty good thanks to the natural sweetness from the vanilla and chocolate chips! If you are making these peanut butter balls for toddlers, this is a good option. Mix-Ins: Add your favorite mix-ins to give these peanut butter energy balls some texture. I find that crushed walnuts, pecans, peanuts, sunflower seeds, and cacao nibs work really well in this recipe. My other favorites are dried fruit like cranberries, raisins, dried apricots, and shredded coconut. I also love adding spices like a pinch of sea salt, cinnamon powder, nutmeg, or pumpkin pie spice into the mixture. When making these as toddler protein balls, be mindful of the size of the nuts and dried fruit. 🍽 Serving Suggestions While I love these healthy bliss balls with peanut butter on their own for an easy grab-and-go snack or healthy dessert, it can be so fun to get creative with other ways to serve these! Try some of these ideas: Toppings: For a decadent dessert I love to drizzle chocolate sauce or caramel sauce (like the one on this no-bake salted caramel cheesecake) over these no bake snacks! Ice Cream: My kids love to mix these no bake peanut butter dessert balls into silken tofu ice cream for a delicious treat. Drinks: Energy balls can be found at a lot of coffee shops nowadays, so it only feels right to create those coffee shop vibes at home!

The best type of peanut butter to use is natural peanut butter with no added sugars, oils, or preservatives. I recommend looking for a brand that has just one ingredient listed: peanuts. You can also use a brand that has peanuts and salt listed as the only two ingredients. How can I adjust the recipe if the mixture is too dry? There are two ways Id recommend adjusting this recipe if your mixture is too dry: 1) Add more peanut butter – itll help bind the ingredients and add moisture. 2) Add a little bit of coconut oil, maple syrup, or even a touch of applesauce – these ingredients will add moisture and flavor to your peanut butter oat balls! no bake peanut butter bliss balls on a white platter 🍪 More Sweet Snacks & Delicious Recipes!

Almond flour: I always use almond flour for my keto graham crackers, because it crisps up nicely when rolled out and baked. I dont recommend coconut flour, as it makes them tough and they dont have the right snap. See nut-free options in the Expert Tips section Sweetener: I like to use an erythritol-based brown sugar replacement for a deeper color and flavor. You must use an erythritol sweetener for these crackers to crisp up properly. Any amount of allulose or BochaSweet will make them soft. So make sure to read the ingredients on your sweetener. See more about sweeteners in the Expert Tips section. Egg: The egg helps bind the dough and hold it together properly. A standard large egg is about 3 1/2 tablespoons of liquid egg. Pantry staples: Butter, baking powder, ground cinnamon, vanilla extract and salt. Step-by-step directions A collage of 6 images showing the steps for making keto graham crackers. 1. Mix it up. In a large bowl, whisk together the almond flour, sweetener, cinnamon, baking powder and salt. Stir in the egg, melted butter, and vanilla extract until the dough comes together. 2. Roll it. Turn the dough out onto a silicone liner and pat into a rough rectangle. Top with a piece piece of parchment and roll out evenly to about 1/4 inch thick. You can go thinner, to 1/8 inch, but they will cook through faster. 3. Score it. Remove the parchment and use a sharp knife or a pizza wheel to score into squares of about 2×2 inches. Prick with a fork to make patterns as desired. 4. Bake it. Transfer the silicone mat to a large baking sheet. Bake at 300ºF for 20 to 30 minutes, until just beginning to brown and firm up. 5. Break it. Remove the crackers and turn the oven off. Let the crackers cool for 30 minutes, then break up along score marks and spread out over the pan in a single layer. 6. Bake again. Return to the warm oven (with the oven off. If it has cooled down too much, turn it on and set the temperature at no higher than 200ºF). Let sit inside another 30 minutes or so, then remove and let cool completely. Expert tips A stack of homemade sugar free graham crackers on a white cupcake stand. It is very important to roll the dough out as evenly as possible. It doesnt matter if you do it thinner than 1/4 inch, but an even thickness means they will bake more evenly. Keep your eye on them regardless as every oven bakes differently. This recipe makes 30 to 40 crackers, depending on how thinly you roll the dough. Nut-Free Option: If you are allergic to almonds, you can use sunflower seed flour. It can be used to replace almond flour in a 1:1 ratio. Be forewarned, however, that it reacts with leavening agents like baking powder and can produce a green color as it cools. You can offset this by using a tablespoon of acid like lemon juice or apple cider vinegar. Sweetener Options As mentioned above, erythritol is the only sweetener that will create a crisp texture in these sugar free graham crackers. Any amount of allulose or BochaSweet will keep them from crisping up properly. That means that the new versions of Swerve Granular and Swerve Brown wont work here (the old formulas are just fine). But you can use other erythritol based sweeteners such as Lakanto and PureCane. If you only have a granular sweetener and want a little of that brown sugar flavor, try adding a teaspoon of molasses along with the egg and butter. It will add less than half a gram of carbs to each serving. Keto graham crackers piled up beside a glass bottle of milk. Frequently Asked Questions Can I eat graham crackers on a low carb diet?

Ingredients Needed You only need 7 simple ingredients to make this recipe. I bet you already have most, if not all of the ingredients in your kitchen right now.

Oats are naturally gluten-free, but if you have celiac or are gluten intolerant make sure you grab certified gluten-free oats. unsweetened almond milk – for soaking the oats and creating the perfect consistency. I like using unsweetened almond milk, but feel free to use your favorite dairy or non-dairy milk (coconut milk, oat milk, cashew milk, soy milk, etc.). I would just recommend using an unsweetened milk as to not add too much extra sugar. greek yogurt – adds creaminess and some extra protein to the oats. I recommend using full fat greek yogurt, but low fat greek yogurt will also work. For a dairy-free/vegan option use a dairy-free yogurt instead. I like this siggis Plain Plant Based Yogurt as it still has some protein. blueberries – the star of the show! You can use either fresh or frozen blueberries for this recipe. chia seeds – helps to soak up some of the liquid and it also adds extra fiber, protein and omega-3 fatty acids to the oats. maple syrup – for natural sweetness. Adjust the amount to suit your taste, or substitute with another sweetener, like honey or date syrup if preferred. For a low-sugar option use stevia or monkfruit. vanilla extract – the perfect flavor enhancer for these oats. Optional Recipe Add-Ins Protein powder: For more protein add 1 scoop of your favorite protein powder to the mixture before letting it set in the fridge. If you do add protein powder, youll need 1/4 cup extra milk, possibly more if you use a plant-based protein powder since it soaks up more liquid. Cinnamon: Feel free to add a dash of cinnamon to the mixture before soaking for a nice warming spice that pairs well with the blueberries. Nut butter: For more flavor and some added protein feel free to add 1-2 Tablespoons of nut butter like peanut butter, almond butter or cashew butter. Add citrus: Want to add lemon?

        "text": "The Best Vegan Breakfast Sandwich By Lauren ToyotaMarch 12, 2018 Image may contain Burger and Food Step 1 To make the vegan egg, drain the tofu of excess water. Place in a high-powered blender with the nondairy milk, nutritional yeast, tapioca flour, turmeric, garlic and onion powders, salt, and pepper. Blend on high until smooth. The batter should be the consistency of a thick pancake batter. Add a bit more nondairy milk if you need to thin it out. Stir in the chopped chives. Step 2 Heat a nonstick pan over medium heat and add a bit of vegan butter. Let it melt and spread it around the frying surface. Pour approximately 1/3 cup of the batter onto the pan and gently spread out to a 6-to 7-inch circle. Cook on the first side for 4 to 5 minutes; the patty should be bubbling and look slightly cooked through and darker in color before flipping. Flip and cook for another 4 to 5 minutes. Fold the patty in half and then in half again, so it looks like youve folded a thick crepe, and cook for another minute on each side to make sure that the middle is thoroughly cooked. Set each folded patty aside on a plate and cover to keep warm. Butter the pan before pouring the next 1/3 cup of batter into the pan. As you go, you might need to lower the heat or adjust cook times, as the pan will get hotter. Step 3 When youre on your last egg patty, set the oven to broil and place the English muffins on a baking sheet. Generously butter each side of the muffins and place 1 piece of cheese on each of the bottom halves. Toast under the broiler for a couple of minutes until the cheese is melted and the muffins are golden brown. Watch closely so the muffins dont burn! Step 4 Place the bacon strips in the pan once the egg patties are done just to heat through. Step 5 To assemble each sandwich, place an egg patty on top of the cheese, add a tomato slice and as many bacon strips as you want, and finish with the top half of the muffin. The patties can be made ahead and heated through in a pan or the oven or in a microwave before serving. You can also store extra batter in the fridge for up to 4 days.

As an Amazon associate, I earn from qualifying purchases. For more information, please read my full disclosure. On the weekends, I like to indulge in a sweet breakfast treat, like pancakes, French toast, glazed donuts, blueberry muffins, or cinnamon rolls. But most days, I prefer to start my day with a savory meal that packs in plenty of protein and vitamins to keep me going all morning long. And it has to be easy to make, too. Enter this delicious vegan breakfast sandwich. Even without pressing the tofu and with just a quick coating of the marinade, this sandwich has a ton of flavor. Its made with soy sauce and Dijon mustard, plus a little bit of egg-like taste from nutritional yeast and black salt (kala namak). Its so good that its been my breakfast nearly every day since Ive developed this recipe. Ingredient  and Substitutions What kind of tofu should I use? Where can I find black salt? If you have any questions about the ingredients in this recipe or what you can use instead, this is the section for you. If you dont see the answer to your question here, please leave me a comment and Ill respond as soon as I can! The ingredients for a vegan breakfast sandwich in small bowls and plates, labeled. extra-firm tofu: I prefer to use a smaller block of tofu (12 oz. or 350 g.) so I dont have to trim it down to fit the English muffins. The most important thing to look for is a tofu that wont crumble when you slice it. Brands of tofu can vary a lot, even when theyre labeled extra-firm. House Foods brand extra-firm tofu has a reputation for holding together well, but if you cant find this brand, you may need to try a few until you find one you like. vegan cheddar slices: You can use any vegan cheddar slices that you like here (or skip them), but I recommend Daiya cheddar slices if you can get them. Theyve reformulated their cheeses recently, and they won our vegan cheese slice taste test unanimously. English muffins: I used my homemade English muffins for this recipe, but you can also choose a store-bought muffin like 365 Brand (just check to make sure its vegan, because many brands arent). You can also use plain toast, a bagel, a vegan croissant, a gluten-free English muffin, or any other bread you like. almond milk: You can use any non-dairy milk here thats plain and unsweetened, including almond, soy, oat, or cashew. nutritional yeast: This is critical for adding some eggy flavor to the marinade. Using fortified nutritional yeast (most grocery store brands are fortified) will give you extra B12 vitamins as well. low-sodium soy sauce: If youre gluten-free, be sure to swap this for a gluten-free alternative like tamari or coconut aminos. turmeric: This gives the tofu its yellow color, and it also contains lots of curcumin, which is associated with anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetic, and antioxidant effects. black salt (kala namak): Black salt is available in the Asian/South Asian section of some grocery stores, or you can buy it online. While this ingredient is optional, it does add a sulfurous flavor that resembles eggs. onion powder, garlic powder, and salt: Seasonings that add savory flavor to the marinade. Three vegan breakfast sandwiches on plates with a cup of coffee in the background. More Topping and Sandwich Layer Ideas This vegan breakfast sandwich is totally flexible, and you can add or swap any layers or toppings you like! Here are some other ingredients you might want to use instead or in addition: vegan cream cheese vegan mayo hot sauce vegan breakfast sausage patty vegan bacon spinach or other greens A vegan breakfast sandwich on a plate, cut in half to show the layers inside. Make Ahead and  To save time in the morning, I prefer to prepare the marinade and soak the tofu slices the night before. This way, I just have to cook the tofu and prepare the sandwich in the morning. If youre only cooking for yourself, you can just cook one tofu slice and keep the extra slices marinating for 3 to 4 days in the refrigerator, using them one at a time. Although I prefer this sandwich freshly cooked, you can also prepare the whole sandwich in advance (skip the avocado and tomato) and reheat it in the microwave, oven, or an air fryer. Wrap the sandwiches individually in parchment paper, then place them in a storage bag in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 days. A hand holding a vegan breakfast sandwich, with a plate and a cup of coffee in the background. Frequently Asked Questions How can I reduce the sodium in this recipe? If youre watching your sodium intake, there are a few ways to reduce the sodium in this tofu breakfast sandwich. The homemade English muffins have about 442 mg of sodium per muffin, so you can use less salt if youre making them at home. You could also choose a lower-sodium option like Whole Foods 365 brand English muffins, which have 230 mg of sodium per muffin. Skipping the black salt (kala namak) will reduce the egg-like flavor, but it will also save you 191 mg of sodium. And skipping the vegan cheddar slice will save about 170 mg of sodium as well. You can also leave the salt out of the marinade, which will reduce the sodium by about 80 mg. Can I make this recipe gluten-free? Sure! Youll need to use gluten-free English muffins (or other gluten-free bread), plus swap out the soy sauce for coconut aminos or gluten-free tamari. Can I make this sandwich less messy for eating on the go? Yes! I wrap up my sandwich in a parchment paper wrapper and fold up the back end several times to catch anything that drips. It makes eating much easier and cleaner. Do I need to press the tofu? No! This recipe tastes great without pressing, however you can press the tofu if you want to. Pressing the tofu will result in a drier, denser texture, instead of the soft and fluffy texture that results from gently squeezing the water out.",

Photograph: Vicky Wasik What is New England-Style Ice Cream? The Elements of New England-Style Ice Cream Why It Works A moderate butterfat content makes for an ice cream that doesnt get too aerated. Evaporated milk, many egg yolks, corn syrup, and arrowroot powder add chewiness and body to the base. Churning the ice cream until its just solid, then freezing it as fast as possible, makes for a dense ice cream that stays extra creamy. True story: I once tried—and failed—to visit the city of Boston twice. Both times the snow has turned me away, because trying to visit 50 restaurants in four days with over a foot of snow on the ground just isnt a good idea. So I sat on my hands with a list of a dozen ice cream shops to visit, shops I had a perverse interest in seeing during a particularly brutal winter. I wanted to witness firsthand just how far New Englands famed obsession with ice cream would go. Would the storefronts be boarded up, with Ned Starks stern face and the text Winter Has Come plastered on the doors? Or would I find them open and bustling, full of ice cream fanatics who, come hell or high snowdrift, couldnt be driven away from their favorite scoops? Boston people: Please tell me what you know. I, left to my own devices, stayed in the kitchen with my ice cream maker. If I couldnt bring myself to Boston, Id bring Boston to me. Meet New England-Style Ice Cream Scooping New England-style ice cream. Serious Eats / Vicky Wasik The city of Boston is not alone in its love of ice cream. All of New England is similarly obsessed. This is, after all, the birthplace of Ben & Jerrys, Emack & Bolios, and Hood. And you dont have to go far in the region to find any number of small family scoop shops that draw crowds even in the coldest months of the year. Those shops are almost uniformly great, serving enormous helpings of classic, no-nonsense flavors piled high and festooned with candy pieces and hot fudge sauce. If you seek the archetypical American ice cream shop experience, New England takes care of you better than anywhere else. Less documented is the fact that New England has developed its own style of ice cream. Im not talking about Philly ice cream, sometimes called New England ice cream (and other times New York ice cream!). Im referring to the ice cream that Jeni Britton Bauer, of Columbus-based Jenis Ice Cream, describes as dense and chewy. Kenji, our resident part-time New Englander, puts New England ice cream thusly: [Its] dense, ultra-rich, ultra-creamy ice cream that is sticky, stretchy, and chewy, almost like taffy. Ice cream you can bite with your teeth and stretch away from the cone, pulling off a bit at a time, letting it slowly melt in your mouth with not a hint of iciness or wateriness. Ice cream that you have to really eat, not just lick. Ice cream thats so dense and creamy that you can polish off an entire cone before it even thinks of beginning to drip onto your hands. Top down view of a glass of New England-style ice cream. Serious Eats / Vicky Wasik New England ice cream is also famous for all the non-ice cream stuff that goes into it. You know: candy bars, brownies, chocolate ribbons, salty pretzels—anything you can smash and smoosh into a scoop of ice cream. If you remember the good old days of Ben & Jerrys before their pints lined every supermarkets freezer aisle, you know what Im talking about. But the real progenitor of adding a bunch of stuff to dense, chewy ice cream is a guy named Steve Herrell, who in 1973 opened Steves Ice Cream in Somerville, MA. Steves was the first shop to slap your ice cream on a frigid marble slab, fold all kinds of stuff into it, and pile it high on an ice cream cone. Many shops followed Steves footsteps, and Cold Stone Creamery made its name by picking up on the marble slab idea. Steve Herrell sold his company in 1977 (the Steves brand is now a Brooklyn-based ice cream company doing its own more trendy thing), then in 1980 opened Herrells in nearby Northampton, MA, and later a scoop shop in Huntington, NY. Hes now retired, but present-day Herrells is pretty much the same stuff as past-day Steves, which is to say delightfully dense and chewy. This is the ice cream I wanted to make at home. It turned out doing so was trickier than I thought. Psh, I thought, Im an ice cream pro by now. This should be a piece of cake à la mode. But New Englanders have reason to be obsessive about their ice cream. Getting it right—really, really right—is no easy task, and doing so took just about every ice cream trick in my book. Is it worth it? Id say so. And if you want to know how to take full control of your ice cream recipes—to manipulate their components to create exactly the kind of ice cream you want—this post has some tips for you. The Secrets of Chew Scoops of New England-style ice cream in a bowl. Serious Eats / Vicky Wasik Ive made a lot of ice cream in my day. Plush, voluptuous Midwestern frozen custard. Light and fluffy eggless Philly ice cream. A buttery and elegant egg- and Scotch-enhanced classic vanilla. But nothing like dense, chewy New England ice cream. So I hit up one of the countrys foremost experts on the subject: Judy Herrell, the current owner of Herrells. How, exactly, do Herrells and shops like it get their ice cream so dense and chewy? You have to churn it very slowly. The faster you go, the more air is whipped into the ice cream. In the ice cream business, that extra air pumped in during churning is called overrun, and the more overrun you bring to an ice cream, the lighter and airier itll feel on the tongue. Thats a fine thing, and ice cream needs some overrun to not taste heavy, but when it comes to my ersatz Herrells ice cream, my goal is to keep that overrun as low as possible. Steve mechanically altered his ice cream machine so it churns slower and brings less air into the ice cream. Judy wont say exactly how—its a company secret—but to replicate the effect at home, her advice is to use an old-fashioned hand-cranked bucket-style ice cream machine that allows you to control the churning speed. Theres even a published recipe to make your own Herrells vanilla. But I, like almost every ice cream maker-owning American these days, dont own a hand-cranked machine. And on motorized machines, theres no way to alter the churn speed at all. I was going to need other ways of reducing overrun and adding some chew to my ice cream. The Elements of [New England] Style An ice cream scoop pressing on a slab of chewy New England-style ice cream on a marble surface. Serious Eats / Vicky Wasik If I couldnt mess with my churn speed, I could alter my recipe. So I asked Judy what goes into the Herrells ice cream base. Its pretty simple: a 14% butterfat dairy mix with sugar, flavorings, and some stabilizers (repeat after me: there is nothing wrong with stabilizers). When you translate that into a home recipe, you get about equal parts milk and cream with a fair amount of sugar. In every part of that formula, theres an opportunity to optimize ingredients and technique to get as dense and chewy an ice cream as possible. Dense and Chewy Ice Cream Element #1: Butterfat Adding Oreos into a slab of chewy New England-style ice cream. Serious Eats / Vicky Wasik You can whip cream but you cant whip milk. The science of why is surprisingly complex and cool, but the big answer comes down to fat—heavy cream is a whopping 37% butterfat while whole milk is just over 3%. Part of the churning process is whipping air into a mixture thats full of cream, and the more cream you add to your ice cream base, the lighter and more aerated itll be. My typical ice cream base calls for two parts cream to one part milk for a balance of buttery richness and an elegant airy lightness. That extra fat also makes for an ice cream thats less likely to turn icy in your freezer in a few days. But in this case, the less air, the better, so Ive cut down to a ratio like Herrells—equal parts cream and milk. Any less cream and it will start feeling icy. Dense and Chewy Ice Cream Element #2: Protein Rolling a slab of ice cream containing Oreo cookies with a bench scraper. Serious Eats / Vicky Wasik Ice cream high in protein, even if its packed full of air, feels dense and chewy in your mouth. Thats why ice cream manufacturers often add non-fat milk powder (i.e. powdered protein) to their recipes. Protein also makes for a less icy ice cream; extra molecular stuff floating in your dairy mix physically obstructs the growth of large, crunchy ice crystals. I toyed around with a few protein options before settling on two: evaporated milk and egg yolks. The milk powder you can buy in supermarkets made for a great chewy texture, but it also brought lots of distracting cooked flavors and a slight chalkiness to the base. Canned evaporated milk—whole milk with only half the water—has a far higher protein-to-water ratio than fresh milk, and once diluted with cream, tastes pretty close to fresh. Theres another big source of protein in ice cream: egg yolks, the more, the better for the creamiest, chewiest, most stable texture. This recipe calls for eight egg yolks per quart. They bring a definite custardy taste to the ice cream, but after testing out smaller amounts, I found eight brings the best balance of flavor and chew. Dense and Chewy Ice Cream Element #3: Sugar Corn syrup pouring out of a bottle. Serious Eats / Robyn Lee This kind of chewy ice cream needs a fair amount of sugar to keep it soft and smooshable, but the kind of sugar matters just as much as the amount. Sucrose, a.k.a. table sugar, is just one option for the enterprising ice cream maker; glucose, maltose, and fructose are all alterna-sugars with different freezing properties. You can get very, very geeky about the sugars in your ice cream, and if you wanna play it that way, do like I do and get some atomized glucose to keep in your cupboard at all times. Not placing a special online order just to make some ice cream? I dont blame you. Especially since one of the best sugars to make plush, dense, and chewy ice cream is right in the supermarket: corn syrup. Yup, plain old corn syrup (please, please, no HFCS laments here). As Ive shown again and again, corn syrup is more viscous and less sweet than a syrup of sucrose and water, and it adds a plush, chewy body to any ice cream or sorbet you make with it. Also, since its only a third as sweet as sucrose, you can use more of it for a softer, creamier ice cream without turning the end result too sweet. I tested an all-sucrose ice cream against one finished with corn syrup, and the latters extra chewiness and subtler sweetness won hands down. Dense and Chewy Ice Cream Element #4: Stabilizers Shaping a slab of chewy New England-style ice cream with a bench scraper and a spoon. Serious Eats / Vicky Wasik I was getting close. Real close. But the recipe wasnt quite right. The ice cream churned up dense and creamy, but it wasnt quite as chewy as I wanted. So I got back on the horn with Judy and strategized. We tossed around a lot of industry-ish options—tapioca syrup, fast-freezing with dry ice, that sort of thing—but this is a recipe I wanted everyone to make at home, even if they didnt have access to exotic pastry ingredients. The answer came in the form of a stabilizer, one thats now commonly available in health food stores and many supermarkets: arrowroot starch, a flavorless powder refined from a tuber. It works miracles as a thickener in pie filling—even better than cornstarch in many cases—and its a common ice cream stabilizer. Not only does it make for less icy ice cream, but it also adds a nice thick body to the base. It was just what I needed to push my recipe over the edge into decidedly chewy territory. Dense and Chewy Ice Cream Element #5: The Churning Challenge Scooping chewy New England-style ice cream that has been stretched on a marble surface into a serving bowl. Serious Eats / Vicky Wasik Pretty much every ice cream recipe on earth includes the line, churn according to manufacturers instructions, an infuriatingly vague string of text that recipe writers (me too) use because it covers every possible ice cream machine out there. What it really means is, churn until the ice cream feels like solid soft serve and isnt runny like a poached egg. For this recipe, you need to be more precise than that. Generally, the final few minutes of churning, when the ice cream goes from soft and velvety to lighter, thicker, and more pillowy, is where a good amount of the ice creams overrun comes from. This is when the ice cream behaves most like whipped cream, drinking in air until its almost cloud-like. For this ice cream, we dont want to let it get to that stage. As soon as your ice cream starts looking and feeling solid and firm—a spoon pressed across the top should leave a clean impression that doesnt collapse—stop the churn. This is the best way to control overrun in a home ice cream machine. The downside of doing so is a warmer ice cream that melts faster as you transfer it from churn to container to freezer. Ice cream that melts and re-freezes will always be icier than before, so get that ice cream into a freezer as fast as possible. Dont worry too much, though—one of the reasons this ice cream is stabilized with lots of eggs, evaporated milk, corn syrup, and arrowroot is to keep it creamy and stable as it hardens in the freezer. Dense and Chewy Ice Cream Element #6: Freezing A serving bowl of chewy New England-style ice cream. Serious Eats / Vicky Wasik Were in the home stretch, but if you want to maximize the effectiveness of your low-overrun churn, you need your ice cream to freeze as fast as possible to minimize the growth of those ice crystals. Unfortunately, home freezers, which maintain a temperature between 10 and 20°F (-12 and -7°C), are pretty much the worst devices for hardening ice cream. The Herrells folks drop their freshly churned ice cream into a super-cold freezer that brings the temperature down to -30 or -40°F (-34 or -40°C) for the creamiest ice cream possible. We home cooks have to improvise. I have a whole post on how best to store ice cream in your freezer, so heres the highlight reel: Store your ice cream in a wide, flat container that will expose more ice cream to freezer air and chill it quickly and evenly. Keep your ice cream in the back and bottom of your freezer, ideally underneath other well-frozen stuff, as a fuller freezer stays cold better. Lastly, dont go opening that freezer door. Every time you do so, youre letting in a flood of warm air that slows down freezing and makes for icier ice cream. And then, eventually, after all that, youll have ice cream. The richest, densest, chewiest ice cream you can make in your home kitchen, ready to get slapped on a marble slab and smashed together with all manner of cookies, brownies, and candy chunks.",

Season the tops of chicken breasts generously with salt and black pepper on both sides. Set chicken aside. Get your cast iron smoking hot BEFORE adding any oil. You dont want your oil to burn. When the skillet is warm, add olive oil and swirl pan to cover the entire surface. Once you see that your oil is hot and shimmery, place your seasoned chicken breasts in the skillet. Sear the chicken breasts for 3 to 4 minutes, or until lightly golden in spots. Repeat on the other side. Carefully transfer the seared chicken breasts to plate and set aside. Return the skillet to the stovetop and reduce heat to medium-low. Let the temperature of the skillet reduce, then add your minced garlic. Next, add in the broth and stir. Make sure to scrape up any browned bits of chicken or garlic that may be stuck to bottom of skillet. Move the skillet to a cool stovetop burner and let skillet cool slightly. Next, add heavy cream and whisk gently to incorporate heavy cream into chicken broth. Once mixed well, sprinkle grated parmesan into mixture and gently stir until cheese has melted. Return the skillet back to the hot burner and continue stirring sauce mixture for about a minute or so. Add your sun-dried tomatoes, dried oregano, and red pepper flakes to the cream sauce and mix. Taste sauce and adjust salt, pepper, oregano, and/or red pepper flakes as desired. Bring sauce to a slow simmer over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally. Once sauce is simmering, return the seared chicken breasts to skillet. Flip chicken breasts a few times to coat all sides in sauce, then transfer entire skillet into preheated oven. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes, or until thermometer reaches 160 degrees in the thickest part of the chicken. Let chicken rest 10 minutes before cutting into it. After 10 minutes, check and make sure chicken is at 165 degrees. Serve with desired sides, such as rice and veggies and enjoy!",

The tofu crumble is super-versatile-try it in burritos, bowls, taco salads and stuffed peppers and on nachos. Tips for Making Beefless Vegan Tacos 1. Choose the Right Kind of Tofu Many people say they dont like tofu, but maybe thats because they havent had it prepared in a delicious way. Tofu is made from soybeans much like cheese is made from milk. Soybeans are soaked, then pureed and drained into soymilk. From there, the soymilk is separated into curds and whey. Then, just like with cheese, the curds are put into molds and pressed. Depending on how long the tofu curds are pressed, the firmer the resulting tofu. Our recipe calls for extra-firm tofu, which works the best for making crumbles. 2. Season the Tofu Well Because of its mild flavor, tofu is very versatile and takes well to all sorts of spices and flavor profiles. To get those classic taco flavors, we combine extra-firm tofu with tamari (or soy sauce), chili powder and garlic powder and then cook the tofu in a little olive oil to infuse the seasonings. 3. Add a Creamy Topping and Great Garnishes The perfect taco is about more than just the filling, of course. Something creamy is a must, so instead of a dollop of sour cream, our tacos are topped with a simple combo of mashed avocado, vegan mayo, lime juice and a little salt. This vegan crema is sort of like thinner guacamole. You can easily mash the avocados for the crema (and for guac) using a potato masher. Pico de gallo or salsa, pickled radishes and shredded lettuce are other nice additions, but feel free to mix it up with your favorite taco toppings. Check Your Wallet: Beef Tacos vs. Vegan Tacos For a price comparison on vegan vs. beef tacos, we turned to vegan celebrity chef Chloe Coscarelli (aka Chef Chloe on Instagram). She explains that vegan beefless tacos cost about $1 less to make and are 23 cents less expensive per serving than beef tacos. If you compare only the protein [for the whole recipe]—ground beef to tofu, the vegan option costs $2.25 while the beef version costs more than double at $4.79, says Coscarelli. And if you decide to go with grass-fed or organic beef, thatll cost you even more—up to $10 per pound! So, any way you look at it, vegan tacos are the cheaper way to go. Environmental Impact: Beef Tacos vs. Vegan Tacos Beef tops the list from the Natural Resources Defense Council as the worst food to eat for climate change because of the emissions associated with beef production. So switching to plant-based protein—like our beefless tacos—can help reduce the environmental impact of your diet. A typical nonvegetarian diet uses 2.9 times more water, 2.5 times more energy and 13 times more fertilizer than a vegetarian diet. Why Switching to a Vegan Diet Is Good for the Planet (and You!) al Comparison: Beef Tacos vs. Vegan Tacos When it comes to nutritional differences, a serving of two vegan beefless tacos has 87 fewer calories than two traditional beef tacos. Vegan tacos have 4 grams more fiber per serving and 3 grams less saturated fat per serving. Our vegan taco recipe will also save you sodium, clocking in with 320 milligrams less per serving than traditional beef tacos. Tofu is a good source of iron, so these vegan tacos have 20 percent of your daily iron needs, just like the beef ones. How Vegans Can Get the Nutrients They Need Even if you enjoy meat, these vegan tacos are a great alternative to add to your repertoire—for Meatless Monday, Taco Tuesday or anytime you want those savory taco flavors without the beef.

        "text": "Healthier Honey Garlic Chicken Jennifer Pallian BSc, RD › Jun 21, 2023, Updated Dec 10, 2024 My Healthier Honey Garlic Chicken recipe just became a new family favourite. Golden, tender bites of chicken sticky, glossy with honey-garlic sauce. So good. No deep fry. I have never seen the kids inhale their dinners so fast. Healthier Honey Garlic Chicken recipe Healthy Honey Garlic Chicken Ingredients: Classic Honey Garlic Chicken is a mall Food Court favourite for me but I wanted to make a lighter, quicker version that was more weekday friendly. I cant believe how yummy it turned out with such a simple line-up of ingredients: Chicken thighs: thighs are more forgiving than chicken breasts and stay juicy and delicious without obsessing over perfect timing. Cornstarch: coating the chicken pieces with cornstarch helps them to retain their moisture as well as providing a dry surface to allow them to brown and crisp beautifully without deep frying. Quick, 4-ingredient healthy honey garlic sauce for chicken. All pantry staples — soy sauce, chicken broth, honey and garlic. For the soy sauce and broth, be sure to use regular and not low-sodium versions or the final dish will lack seasoning. (If low salt is what you have on hand, mix 3/4 tsp of kosher salt with the cornstarch before tossing the chicken). How to Make Honey Garlic Sauce Chicken My version of Honey Garlic Chicken lightens up not only the final dish, but also the workload. In this recipe, I skipped the deep fry and did everything in one pan, cutting back on effort majorly. The flavour, however, remains amazing. Toss chicken with cornstarch and cook in a single layer and cook, undisturbed, until deeply golden on the bottom. Flip and cook until golden on the other side (dont worry about cooking it through yet). Cook the garlic on one side of the pan. If you just stir it in with the chicken, it will have less contact with the heat and some raw garlic flavour will remain. Pour in the sauce ingredients. It has a brief awkward stage where the sauce is super thin and youll be like — is this soup??! But be patient. The cornstarch on the chicken will thicken the sauce as it reduces, and in a few minutes of simmering youll have a glossy, shiny, sticky sauce. If you have a few extra minutes, you can transfer the browned chicken to a plate before you add the garlic to the pan. Let the sauce reduce and thicken before you add the chicken and toss to coat. This will preserve the chickens crispy crust (but dirties another plate). Choose your own adventure.

Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat until shimmering hot. Add chicken in a single layer and cook, undisturbed, until deeply golden on the bottom. Flip and cook another 2 minutes ((dont worry about cooking it through yet). Meanwhile, whisk together honey, chicken broth and soy sauce and set aside. Push chicken to one side of the skillet. Cook garlic in the empty part of the skillet until soft, about 2 minutes. Add honey mixture and stir through chicken to coat. Let it come to a simmer and thicken, 2-3 minutes more. Chicken should reach 165ºF inside. Top with green onions.  For the soy sauce and broth, be sure to use regular and not low-sodium versions or the final dish will be a bit bland. (If its what you have on hand, mix 3/4 tsp of kosher salt with the cornstarch before tossing the chicken). If you have a few extra minutes, you can transfer the browned chicken to a plate before you add the garlic to the pan. Finish the sauce like this on its own (letting it reduce and thicken) before you add the chicken and toss to coat. This will preserve the chickens crispy crust (but dirties another plate).

Although comforting and deliciously creamy the sauce is low in fat and does not contain heavy cream. You might also like creamy turkey steaks and meatballs in white sauce. Top down view of 4 chicken breasts in white sauce with spoon in large white pan, with green cloth to the right and plates at the top. What I love about this chicken in white sauce recipe is that, in addition to being simple to make and healthy, it is extremely versatile. Its delicious served over pasta, with potatoes, rice as well as steamed vegetables. So you can serve it with your favourite side dish. I used my simple white sauce recipe plus a few extra ingredients to add more richness and flavour into this chicken dish. HOW TO FLAVOUR CHICKEN IN WHITE SAUCE I used a bit of crumbled vegetable stock cube, Dijon mustard and onion granules for more flavour but you can create your own flavour combination. For example add lemon zest, a drizzle of lemon juice and 1 teaspoon of dried thyme into the sauce. These ingredients are delicious in chicken dishes (I used them in my creamy chicken potato bake). I only used chives for garnish but fresh parsley and dill would work well too. You can also add grated garlic into the sauce and serve the dish with a few spoonfuls of parmesan cheese. If not using fresh herbs add herbs de Provence into the sauce as its cooking if you like (approx. 1.5 tsp). Side view of chicken in white sauce in large shallow white pan, with plates, lid and pepper grinder in background. You can also substitute half of the milk with either chicken or vegetable stock (and omit the stock cube I used). I added a bit of fromage frais (fromage blanc) into the recipe, which is my go-to ingredient when it comes to creating creamy, healthy sauces as its virtually fat free, but you could use crème fraiche or sour cream instead if you prefer (both a lot more calorific than fromage frais). PREPARING THE CHICKEN You can cook whole chicken breasts or cut them in half down the middle before frying to shorten cooking time (and to serve smaller portions). You can also flatten and tenderise the chicken using a meat mallet (or rolling pin) before cooking. This will also shorten cooking time. HOW TO MAKE CREAMY CHICKEN IN WHITE SAUCE: STEP-BY-STEP 1.In a large shallow pan heat up 3 tablespoons of oil and fry the chicken breasts for 2-3 minutes on each side over a medium heat (or until golden brown). Transfer the chicken onto a plate, cover and set aside (leave the juices, if any, in the pan). 4 chicken breasts in large shallow white pan. 2. In the same pan melt the butter over a fairly low heat, add the flour and whisk together until a thick, smooth paste forms (this is roux). Top down view of roux in large shallow white pan with green whisk. 3. Add the wine, stir, then add half of the milk, increase the heat and whisk until the sauce starts to thicken. Add the rest of the milk, crumbled stock cube, mustard, onion granules, pepper to taste and continue whisking until the sauce thickens and starts bubbling up. Whisk in the fromage frais, taste the sauce and adjust the seasoning as necessary. Milk, crumbled stock cube and mustard in large shallow white pan with green whisk. 4. Place the chicken back in the pan, coat in the sauce, cover and simmer for 10-15 minutes or until the chicken is fully cooked. Add a splash of water if needed, stir and serve immediately. 4 chicken breasts in creamy sauce in large shallow white pan with lid in top right. TOP TIPS FOR MAKING CHICKEN WITH WHITE SAUCE Cooking times may vary depending on the size of your chicken breasts. If you want to shorten cooking time cut the chicken breasts down the middle before frying. You can also flatten and tenderise the chicken using a meat mallet (or rolling pin) before cooking. This will also shorten cooking time. The sauce will thicken after a while so add a splash of water to loosen it (stir it in using a whisk). It is important to use a whisk, rather than a spoon, to make the sauce (to ensure its smooth). Gluten free white sauce: You can replace the wheat flour with corn flour (use 20 g) to make this sauce gluten free. Substitutions: Add half the amount of milk and top up with chicken/vegetable stock. Seasoning: You may not need to add any salt into the sauce as the stock cube is quite salty. Add plenty of pepper though. Best served immediately. Leftovers can be refrigerated, covered, for up to 2 days. Add a splash of water when reheating the sauce (you may have to adjust the seasoning too). 4 chicken breasts with chopped chives in large shallow white pan with spoon, green cloth to the right and plates with forks at the top.

Mushrooms have been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties, helping to prevent chronic diseases, including heart disease, cancer and cognitive decline. Tofu is simply made from soybeans, water and a coagulant (to help it set up). It is an excellent source of complete plant-based protein and iron. While soybeans are loaded with fiber, they lose most of it during the process of becoming tofu. Tofu made with calcium sulfate as its coagulant provides a nice dose of calcium, too.
